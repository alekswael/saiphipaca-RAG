Human: What is divergent thinking and how does it contribute to creativity?
Assistant: Divergent thinking is the process of producing multiple or alternative answers from available information. It contributes to creativity by requiring the making of unexpected combinations, recognizing links among remote associates, and transforming information into unexpected forms."
3;2;"Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, both convergent and divergent thinking lead to production of ideas. Nonetheless, there is a major qualitative difference: Convergent thinking usually generates orthodoxy, whereas divergent thinking always generates variability (Cropley, 1999); otherwise, it would not be divergent. This seems at first glance to confirm that divergent thinking is synonymous with creativity. Indeed, in discussing creativity, Guilford (1959) focused on sensitivity to problems, word fluency, ideational fluency, semantic flexibility, associational fluency, and originality; all aspects of divergent thinking.";In Praise of Convergent Thinking;What is the difference between convergent and divergent thinking in terms of idea generation, and how is divergent thinking related to creativity?;The difference between convergent and divergent thinking in terms of idea generation lies in the type of ideas they produce. Convergent thinking typically generates orthodoxy, or conventional and traditional ideas, while divergent thinking always generates variability, or a wide range of different ideas. Divergent thinking is related to creativity as it encompasses aspects such as sensitivity to problems, word fluency, ideational fluency, semantic flexibility, associational fluency, and originality, which are all key components of creativity.;"Text: Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, both convergent and divergent thinking lead to production of ideas.

3;4;Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between mere novelty and novelty that earns the label “creativity.” The former involves what Cattell and Butcher (1968, p. 271) called “pseudocreativity”: The novelty derives only from nonconformity, lack of discipline, blind rejection of what already exists, and simply letting oneself go. Based on the German of Heinelt (1974), I have added to this “quasicreativity” (e.g., Cropley, 1997, p. 89), which has many of the elements of genuine creativity—such as a high level of fantasy—but only a tenuous connection with reality. An example would be the novelty generated in daydreams.;In Praise of Convergent Thinking;What is the difference between pseudocreativity and quasicreativity as defined by Cattell, Butcher, and Heinelt?;Pseudocreativity, as defined by Cattell and Butcher, refers to novelty that arises from nonconformity, lack of discipline, blind rejection of what already exists, and simply letting oneself go. On the other hand, quasicreativity, a term added by Heinelt, refers to a type of novelty that has many elements of genuine creativity, such as a high level of fantasy, but only a tenuous connection with reality, like the novelty generated in daydreams.;"Text: Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between mere novelty and novelty that earns the label “creativity.” The former involves what Cattell and Butcher (1968, p. 271) called “pseudocreativity”: The novelty derives only from nonconformity, lack of discipline, blind rejection of what already exists, and simply letting oneself go.

4;2;"Luck and Chance There are many examples of apparently lucky combinations of events that led to acknowledged creative solutions (see Rosenman, 1988): For instance, Pasteur, Fleming, Roentgen, Becquerel, Edison, Galvani, and Nobel all described chance events that led them to breakthroughs. Some famous thinkers such as Ernst Mach, Etienne Souriau, or Alexander Bain have even concluded that luck is the main factor in creativity. Austin (1978) identified four kinds of happy chance: blind chance (the individual creator plays no role except that of being there at the relevant moment); serendipity (a person stumbles on something novel and effective when not looking for it); the luck of the diligent (a hardworking person finds in an unexpected setting something that is being sought—Diaz de Chumaceiro, 1999, p. 228, called this “pseudoserendipity” because in genuine serendipity the person would not be looking for what was found); and self-induced luck (special qualifications of a person—such as knowledge, close attention to detail, or willingness to work long hours—create the circumstances for a lucky breakthrough).";In Praise of Convergent Thinking;What are the four kinds of happy chance identified by Austin in relation to creativity and luck?;The four kinds of happy chance identified by Austin in relation to creativity and luck are blind chance (the individual creator plays no role except that of being there at the relevant moment), serendipity (a person stumbles on something novel and effective when not looking for it), the luck of the diligent (a hardworking person finds in an unexpected setting something that is being sought), and self-induced luck (special qualifications of a person—such as knowledge, close attention to detail, or willingness to work long hours—create the circumstances for a lucky breakthrough).;"Text: Luck and Chance There are many examples of apparently lucky combinations of events that led to acknowledged creative solutions (see Rosenman, 1988): For instance, Pasteur, Fleming, Roentgen, Becquerel, Edison, Galvani, and Nobel all described chance events that led them to breakthroughs.

1;3;INTRODUCTION More than thirty years ago, Kogan (1974) conducted an extensive and then-definitive review of gender differences in creativity. He opened his paper with apoint that is as salient today as it was when it was written: Any behavioral scientistwho would argue that one gender is more creative than another would face tre-mendous scrutiny and a row of critics. With some relief, he continued, he found“relative equality” in creativity among males and females.;Journal of Creative Behavior - 2011 - BAER - Gender Differences in Creativity;What were the findings of Kogan's review on gender differences in creativity conducted over thirty years ago?;Kogan's review on gender differences in creativity, conducted over thirty years ago, found relative equality in creativity among males and females.;"Text: INTRODUCTION More than thirty years ago, Kogan (1974) conducted an extensive and then-definitive review of gender differences in creativity.

4;4;The second subsection (Gender Differences in Subjective Assessments) goes into more detail about self-assessments, assessments by others, and personality-style assessments. The third subsection (Gender Differences in Creative Achievement) considers differences in creative accomplishment. This subsection does not document differences in achievement across a wide variety of domains. The existence of such differences is widely recognized, but far more research effort has gone into trying to understand the causes of such differences (as described below in the Theories of Gender Differences in Creativity section of this paper) than has gone into trying to document them. The evidence of differences in creative achievement reviewed in this subsection includes just one study of what might be thought of as long-term real-world achievement. (That study is, in fact, an investigation of publication success in the field of creativity research.) The rest of the subsection reviews gender differences in studies of the creativity of actual products (e.g., poems, stories, collages) created by subjects in psychological experiments.;Journal of Creative Behavior - 2011 - BAER - Gender Differences in Creativity;"What does the third subsection of the paper, ""Gender Differences in Creative Achievement,"" focus on and what type of studies does it review?";"The third subsection, ""Gender Differences in Creative Achievement,"" focuses on the differences in creative accomplishments between genders.

4;6;"Divergent thinking tests have dominated creativity testing, and the various Torrance Tests (Torrance, 1966a, 1966b, 1966c, 1970, 1981, 1988, 1990a, 1990b; Torrance, Khatena, & Cunnington, 1973) have dominated the field of divergent thinking testing.

3;2;Continuing, Yet familiar as the effects of Genius are, it is not easy to define what Genius is. The etymology of the term will, however, assist us. It is derived from the verb, signifying to engender or create, because it has the quality of originating new combinations of thought, and of presenting them with great clearness and force. Originality of conception, and energy of expression, are essential to Genius.
