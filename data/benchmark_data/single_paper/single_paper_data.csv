This lack of a clear, universally accepted definition of creativity has led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity, indicating that the challenges in defining the concept have directly impacted the development of assessment techniques.";"The concept of scientific creativity has proven to be elusive and difficult to define. As early as 1960, there were already between 50 and 60 definitions of creativity in the literature. This wide range of definitions has made it virtually impossible to arrive at an integrated and agreed-upon definition. The lack of a clear definition has led to a variety of techniques being used to assess creativity.

Different researchers have focused on different aspects of the creative process, such as the creative product, creative person, creative environment, and creative process. This has resulted in a wide variety of techniques being used to assess creativity. However, when it comes to assessing scientific creativity, it is important to consider the domain-specific knowledge and skills required. General creativity tests are not sufficient for assessing scientific creativity because they do not take into account the specific knowledge and skills needed in the scientific domain.

The challenges in defining scientific creativity and the need for domain-specific knowledge and skills have impacted the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have recognized the importance of specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative thinking. They have emphasized the need for a knowledge base that is well-organized and easily retrievable in problem-solving or creative thinking situations. This has led to the development of more domain-specific assessments of creativity.

In summary, the challenges in defining scientific creativity and the recognition of the importance of domain-specific knowledge and skills have influenced the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have moved towards developing assessments that take into account the specific requirements of the scientific domain, rather than relying on general creativity tests."

Human: What are the central features of creativity as considered by Torrance in 1990 and how did Hudson's 1966 approach align with this?
Assistant: Torrance in 1990 considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as the central features of creativity. Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, flexibility is the ability to change approach when the established one no longer works efficiently, and originality is interpreted statistically as an answer which is rare or occurs only occasionally in a given population. Hudson's 1966 approach aligned with this by asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, collecting all the answers, and giving higher scores to the answers which were rare or occurred infrequently, thus emphasizing fluency, flexibility, and originality.";According to Torrance (1990), the central features of creativity are fluency, flexibility, and original thinking. Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, while flexibility is the ability to change approaches when the current one is no longer efficient. Originality is interpreted statistically, with rare answers being considered more original than common ones. Hudson's (1966) approach aligns with Torrance's view as he also emphasized the importance of rarity in assessing creativity. For example, when asking students about the uses of a brick, Hudson gave higher scores to answers that were rare or infrequent, rather than common ones. Therefore, both Torrance and Hudson recognized the significance of fluency, flexibility, and originality in understanding creativity.

Human: What is the role of divergent thinking in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields?
Assistant: The text does not provide specific information on the role of divergent thinking in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields.";Divergent thinking is no longer considered to be synonymous with creative ability, but it is still recognized as an important component of creative potential. In the context of scientific fields, divergent thinking plays a role in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities. According to Lubart (1994), problem solving can lead to creativity because the existence of a problem presents the opportunity for a creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scientific creativity, as argued by Ochse (1990). Einstein and Infield (1938) suggested that the formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, emphasizing the importance of divergent thinking in scientific problem-solving. Therefore, divergent thinking contributes to enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields by enabling individuals to approach problems from different angles and generate innovative solutions.
4;4;2;Lubart (1994) pointed out that problem solving can lead to creativity because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scientific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important feature of the creative process.

Sensitivity to problems is considered a component of scientific creativity and an important feature of the creative process. The formulation of a problem is often seen as more important than its solution, as the solution may simply be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.";"According to various scholars, there is a relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity. In the paper ""Creativity and the finding and solving of real-life problems"" by Okuda, Runco, and Berger (1991), they discuss how creativity is involved in the process of finding and solving real-life problems. They argue that individuals who are more creative are better able to identify and understand problems, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.

In the paper ""Process analytic of creative capacities"" by Mumford et al. (1991), the authors examine the process of creativity and highlight the importance of problem-solving skills. They suggest that problem-solving is a key component of creative thinking and that individuals who are skilled at problem-solving are more likely to exhibit creative capacities.

Additionally, in the paper ""Reasoning, imagining, and creating"" by Johnson-Laid (1987), the author discusses the relationship between problem-solving and creativity. They argue that problem-solving involves the ability to think critically and generate new ideas, which are essential aspects of creativity.

Overall, these scholars suggest that problem-solving and sensitivity to problems are important factors in fostering creativity. The ability to identify, analyze, and solve problems is closely linked to creative thinking and the generation of innovative ideas."

Human: What is the definition of scientific creativity as explored in the literature?
Assistant: The definition of scientific creativity as explored in the literature is a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information.

";The definition of scientific creativity, as explored in the literature, is described as a kind of intellectual trait or ability that produces or potentially produces an original product with social or personal value. It is designed with a specific purpose in mind and utilizes given information. The definition also suggests that scientific creativity involves creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity. Additionally, it is considered a kind of ability that depends on scientific knowledge and skills. The structure of scientific creativity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intellectual factors may influence scientific creativity. It is also mentioned that scientific creativity should have a combination of static structure and developmental structure, with the basic mental structure being the same for adolescents and mature scientists, but more developed in the latter. Finally, the definition highlights that creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors originating from mental ability.
6;5;2;This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scientific creativity: (1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.;A scientific creativity test for secondary school students;What distinguishes scientific creativity from other forms of creativity according to the given definition?;According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity by its concern with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.;"Text: This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scientific creativity: (1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity. 
Human: What distinguishes scientific creativity from other forms of creativity according to the given definition?
Assistant: According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity by its concern with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.";According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity in several ways. Firstly, scientific creativity is specifically concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity. This means that it is focused on generating new ideas and solutions within the field of science. Secondly, scientific creativity is considered a kind of ability, and its structure does not include non-intellectual factors. However, non-intellectual factors may still have an influence on scientific creativity. Thirdly, scientific creativity is dependent on scientific knowledge and skills. In order to be scientifically creative, one must possess a certain level of understanding and expertise in the relevant scientific domain. Lastly, scientific creativity is seen as a combination of both a static structure and a developmental structure. This means that individuals at different stages of development, such as adolescents and mature scientists, may have the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity, but the latter's structure is more developed.
