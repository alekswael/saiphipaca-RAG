It was used to develop a test for measuring scientific creativity in secondary school students by initially being evaluated by 50 science teachers in China. Their analyses and comments, along with the experience drawn from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, were used to develop and validate a 7-item scale for measuring scientific creativity. This scale was validated through analyses of item response data from 160 secondary school students in England.

4;1;Divergent thinking is no longer considered to be synonymous with creative ability, it is nevertheless an important component of creative potential (Runco 1991). When we consider scientific products, we can distinguish between technical products, advances in science knowledge, understanding of scientific phenomena, and scientific problem solving.

4;2;Lubart (1994) pointed out that problem solving can lead to creativity because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scientific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important feature of the creative process. Einstein and Infeld (1938) suggested that the formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, which may be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.;A scientific creativity test for secondary school students;What is the relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity according to various scholars?;According to various scholars, problem-solving can lead to creativity because the existence of a problem opens up the possibility of a creative solution. Sensitivity to problems is considered a component of scientific creativity and an important feature of the creative process. The formulation of a problem is often seen as more important than its solution, as the solution may simply be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.;"Text: Lubart (1994) pointed out that problem solving can lead to creativity because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution.

5;1;Research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be based.

5;2;This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scientific creativity: (1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.;A scientific creativity test for secondary school students;What distinguishes scientific creativity from other forms of creativity according to the given definition?;According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity by its concern with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.;"Text: This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scientific creativity: (1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.

5;8;Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (Torrance 1990). This is a paper-and-pencil test which taps divergent thinking abilities. Items are scored for fluency, flexibility, and original thinking. Recently, activity-based approaches in measuring creativity have also been used (Kitto et al. 1994).;A scientific creativity test for secondary school students;What are the scoring criteria for the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking?;The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking is scored for fluency, flexibility, and original thinking.;"Text: Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (Torrance 1990).

5;9;As to scientific creativity of secondary school students, several tests have been developed. Friedlander (1983) developed a test in which 143 high school students responded to a plant or animal stimulus through a series of divergent thinking questions dealing with data collection, problem solving, hypothesis construction, and planning experiments.

14;3;However, more work needs to be done to further validate the test. Test-retest reliability should be evaluated. Relationships between this test and other scientific creativity tests as well as other general creativity tests might be studied. More importantly, predictive validity should be determined.
