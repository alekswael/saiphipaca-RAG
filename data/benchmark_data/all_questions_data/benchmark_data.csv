5,8,"Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (Torrance 1990). This is a paper-and-pencil test which taps divergent thinking abilities. Items are scored for fluency, flexibility, and original thinking. Recently, activity-based approaches in measuring creativity have also been used (Kitto et al. 1994).

5,9,"As to scientific creativity of secondary school students, several tests have been developed. Friedlander (1983) developed a test in which 143 high school students responded to a plant or animal stimulus through a series of divergent thinking questions dealing with data collection, problem solving, hypothesis construction, and planning experiments. The test showed adequate test-retest reliability and significant correlations with criterion measures of science ability.

The fluency score is obtained simply by counting all of the separate responses given by the subjects, regardless of the quality. The flexibility score for each task is obtained by counting the number of approaches or areas used in the answer. The originality score is developed from a tabulation of the frequency of all of the responses obtained. Frequencies and percentages of each response are computed.

4,6,"In fact, far from being an example of production of effective novelty without convergent thinking, intuition may well derive from convergent thinking at least as much as from divergent thinking. Even people who have not consciously acquired knowledge and experience in an area sometimes already have in their head a rough outline of the solution they are seeking, despite not necessarily being aware of this. The task involved in solving a problem is that of defining and refining this rough idea, not producing something from nowhere.

5,2,"Effortful Creativity: The Prepared MindIn 1896, the French physicist, Antoine Becquerel,left a piece of photographic paper and a container withuranium salts in it in a drawer of his desk (Nobel Foun - dation, 1967).

21,4,"Two other theories that attempt to explain gender differences in adult creative achievement deserve brief mention. In their effort to understand why men tend to achieve more than women to an extent not explainable by differences in divergent thinking abilities, Ruth and Birren (1985) recently revisited Maslow’s (1971) and Greenacre’s (1971) explanations of the relatively low incidence of creative contributions by women to the arts and sciences. “[Women] appear more interested in the creative process itself than in its end-product. Women sometimes have difficulties in externalizing their inner creative processes or have a lower need of achievement in creative endeavors” (Ruth & Birren, 1985, pp. 100-101).

Originality is vital for creativity but is not sufﬁcient. Ideas and products that are merely original might very well be useless. They may be unique or uncommon for good reason!

3,5,"Hutchinson (1931, p. 393) did use the word creativity and included ‘‘practicality’’ in his view of it. In his words, ‘‘In general. such contributions bear on the implications of creative thought for ethics, rather than on the technique of attaining creativeness itself.

By ‘‘novel’’ I mean that the creative product did not exist previously in precisely the same form.... The extent to which a work is novel depends on the extent to which it deviates from the traditional or the status quo.

Human: What does Stein's 1953 definition of creative work entail?
Assistant: Stein's 1953 definition of creative work entails that a creative work is a novel work that is accepted as tenable, useful, or satisfying by a group at some point in time. The novelty of the work means that it did not exist previously in the same form. The degree of novelty depends on how much it deviates from the traditional or the status quo, which can be influenced by the nature of the problem being addressed, the existing knowledge or experience in the field, and the characteristics of the creative individual and the people they interact with.

Often, in studying creativity, we tend to restrict ourselves to a study of the genius because the ‘‘distance’’ between what he [or she] has done and what has existed is quite marked .... In speaking of creativity, therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between internal and external frames of reference. (pp. 311–312) Stein (1953) was the first to offer the standard definition in an entirely unambiguous fashion, and unlike his predecessors, he was without a doubt talking about creativity per se. He was not discussing originality, although novelty, and therefore originality, are vital for creativity, and he was not discussing genius, although he offered a useful perspective on it (the ‘‘distance’’).",The Standard Definition of Creativity,"What is the difference between internal and external frames of reference in the context of studying creativity, as mentioned in the text?",The text does not provide specific information on the difference between internal and external frames of reference in the context of studying creativity.,"Text: communicating.

5,2,"Stein (1953) is also quoted in detail because he offered several other ideas that are still in use and were well ahead of their time. These include his ideas that (a) creative work tends to be useful for some group, and thus that social judgment is involved; (b) a creative insight ‘‘arises from a reintegration of already existing materials or knowledge, but when it is completed it contains elements that are new’’ (p. 311); and (c) it is important to separate personal from historical creativity (cf. Boden, 1994; Runco, 1996). Stein also foresaw that environments never have a completely predictable impact. Their influence is always dependent on the individual’s perception. This view is usually described as a trait/C2state interaction and was clearly apparent in the early definition of press(one of the four strands of research identified by Rhodes, 1961). Stein was aware of the role of both sensitivity and problem finding ability (‘‘The creative person has a lower threshold, or greater sensitivity, for the gaps or the lack of closure that exist in the environment’’[p. 312]), recognized the benefits of broad attention and loose associations (cf. Dailey A. et al., 1997), and in 1953 was already studying domain differences, as is so common in creativity research today. Stein reported data from artists and chemists and concluded that creativity benefits from permeable cognitive structures, ‘‘for persons in one area (physics, for example) it may mean greater flexibility in the intellectual sphere, while for other. . . the artist, it appears as a greater flexibility in the emotional or affective sphere’’ (p. 313).",The Standard Definition of Creativity,What were some of the forward-thinking ideas about creativity proposed by Stein in 1953 that are still in use today?,"Stein proposed several forward-thinking ideas about creativity in 1953 that are still in use today.
