As discussed  above, well-designed digital games can facilitate the  \u2018flow state\u2019 when there are clear goals, immediate feedback and an appropriate balance between challenges and  skills (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997 ). The flow state is important for creating an environment which affords the creativity of the players so creativity can be assessed.  Additionally, just as researchers assert that multiple  tasks are needed to assess elements of creativity (Acar  & Runco, 2019 ; Cortes et al., 2019 ; Runco et al., 2016 ), it  can be asserted that progression through game levels,  modes and rounds are also needed in order for digital  games to supply sufficiently comprehensive and diverse  data to accurately and reliably assess creativity.\n### Input: How does the complexity of a game relate to its ecological and construct validity in assessing creativity?\n### Response: The complexity of a game relates to its ecological and construct validity in assessing creativity by providing clear goals, immediate feedback, and an appropriate balance between challenges and skills. This facilitates the 'flow state' which is important for creating an environment that affords the creativity of the players. Additionally, the complexity of a game, through progression through game levels, modes and rounds, provides sufficiently comprehensive and diverse data to accurately and reliably assess creativity.\n\n"}

To get there, it will require us to rethink how we study and measure cognitive abilities. Much of what cognitive and behavioral scientists know about cognitive abilities and psychological behavior has been gleaned from studying small, homogeneous groups in the laboratory. Recent pushes to increase the number and diversity of participants (Bauer, 2020) are revolutionizing standards for power and generalizability across the cognitive and behavioral sciences. These advances have been enabled in part by moving from in-person testing to online equivalents, which are less costly for experimenters and more convenient for participants (Birnbaum, 2004). The maturation of these tools will be critical to realizing the promise of individual cognitive phenotyping, customizable diagnostics, and a revamp of intelligence research in general.\n### Input: What role does online testing play in the advancement of individual cognitive phenotyping and intelligence research?\n### Response: Online testing plays a significant role in the advancement of individual cognitive phenotyping and intelligence research by enabling the inclusion of a larger and more diverse group of participants. This increases the power and generalizability of the studies. Online testing is also less costly for experimenters and more convenient for participants, which further facilitates the expansion and diversification of the participant pool. The maturation of these online tools is critical to realizing the potential of individual cognitive phenotyping, customizable diagnostics, and a revamp of intelligence research.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: Based on visualizations and simulations, we showed that the neighborhood function influences how rugged a landscape will appear to the searcher. Since one cannot just assume one-bit-flip search [28, 32], this turns out to be a fundamental challenge to any a priori assessment of fitness landscapes. Second, even if one assumes one-bit-flip search, there are substantial challenges to traditional, quantitative measurements. Landscapes can be hierarchical and thus deceptive[32,55], and neutrality can influence how adaptive search unfolds in a given fitness landscape [18]. Given our limited understanding about the genotype-phenotype mapping in a technological setting [75], we suggest that the focus should not be on the statistical features of the landscape to be searched under the one-bit-flip condition but should be on how the interplay of search behaviors and the different natures of interdependence structures translate into problem-solving performance. One way forward, as suggested by current developments in computer science, is to revert to what Wright [4] and Kauffman [6] originally proposed: relying on fitness landscapes to first acquire a \u201crough\u201d image of a problem class, instead of investigating specific instances [7, 42]. This would entail moving beyond a simple, quantitative assessment of the topology (cf. the K\/N ratio) or even the more sophisticated approach by Jones and Forrest [53].\n### Input: What challenges are presented by the one-bit-flip search assumption in the assessment of fitness landscapes?\n### Response: The one-bit-flip search assumption presents several challenges in the assessment of fitness landscapes. First, the neighborhood function's influence on the ruggedness of the landscape cannot be overlooked. Second, traditional quantitative measurements face substantial challenges even under this assumption. This is because landscapes can be hierarchical and deceptive, and neutrality can influence how adaptive search unfolds in a given fitness landscape. Furthermore, there is limited understanding about the genotype-phenotype mapping in a technological setting, which complicates the assessment.\n\n"}

Rafner et al. \/ Human Computation (2022) 9:1    81      projects there exists a class of tasks that is characterized by intuitive processing and the application of common sense (information processing or physical actions that most participants can do almost instinctively). In these cases, nearly all participants can contribute to using general human cognitive and motoric abilities (see Fig 1, y-axis) thus have \u201cbroad accessibility\u201d. The apparent simplicity of these tasks from the human perspective stands in dramatic contrast to the challenge of replicating them with AI technologies, which is one of the grand challenges of the AI field (Marcus, 2018, 2020). At the other end of this spectrum lie projects where only a small fraction of participants are able to contribute (e.g. Decodocu, UK butterfly monitoring scheme), thus have \u201climited accessibility\u201d. \n### Input: What is the difference between tasks characterized by intuitive processing and those that have limited accessibility in human computation projects?\n### Response: Tasks characterized by intuitive processing in human computation projects are those that most participants can do almost instinctively, using general human cognitive and motoric abilities. These tasks have \"broad accessibility\" as nearly all participants can contribute to them. On the other hand, tasks that have \"limited accessibility\" are those where only a small fraction of participants are able to contribute. These tasks may require specialized knowledge or skills, as seen in projects like Decodocu and the UK butterfly monitoring scheme.\n\n"}

However, as certain kinds of scientific research becomes inextricable from the  software that supports them, software curation and preservation are becoming essential  to secure the integrity of the scholarly record (Chassanoff and Altman 2020 ). Moreover, the pervasiveness of everyday technologies and broad participation in  social media can facilitate scientific dissemination and engagement with the public  (Newman et al. 2012 ). While popular commercial applications such as Google\u2019s  G Suite leave users little control over how to engage with them, purpose-built tools like  SciNote (SciNote 2020 ), developed by ScienceAtHome, emulate elements of the process  of scientific argumentation (Fischer et al. 2014 ) and allow users to collaboratively create,  share, and evaluate each other\u2019s ideas. Finally, Wikipedia, the largest open collaborative  knowledge effort, which was initially revolutionary and has become an everyday tool, has  been an important model for self-organising Open Science communities (Arazy et al.  2016 ; Faraj, Jarvenpaa, and Majchrzak 2011 ).\n### Input: What role does software curation and preservation play in maintaining the integrity of scientific research and how do tools like SciNote facilitate scientific argumentation and collaboration?\n### Response: Software curation and preservation play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of scientific research by ensuring that the software supporting the research is properly managed and preserved. This is particularly important as certain types of scientific research become inseparable from the software that supports them. Without proper curation and preservation, the software could become obsolete or unusable, potentially compromising the research it supports.\n\nTools like SciNote facilitate scientific argumentation and collaboration by emulating elements of the scientific argumentation process. They allow users to collaboratively create, share, and evaluate each other\u2019s ideas, fostering a collaborative environment for scientific research. This can enhance the quality of the research by allowing for a diversity of perspectives and ideas. Furthermore, these tools can also facilitate the dissemination of scientific research, making it more accessible to the public.\n\n"}

Some progress has been made toward devising measures that can be applied at scale across individuals and populations. What has been missing is a broad battery of validated tasks that can be easily deployed, used across different age ranges and social backgrounds, and employed in practical, clinical, and research contexts. Here, we present Skill Lab, a game-based approach allowing the efficient assessment of a suite of cognitive abilities. Skill Lab has been validated outside the lab in a crowdsourced population-size sample recruited in collaboration with the Danish Broadcast Company (Danmarks Radio, DR). Our game-based measures are five times faster to complete than the equivalent traditional measures and replicate previous findings on the decline of cognitive abilities with age in a large population sample. Furthermore, by combining the game data with an in-game survey, we demonstrate that this unique dataset has implication for key questions in social science, challenging the Jack-of-all-Trades theory of entrepreneurship and provide evidence for risk preference being independent of executive functioning.\n### Input: What is the Skill Lab and how does it revolutionize the assessment of cognitive abilities in psychology and social sciences?\n### Response: Skill Lab is a game-based approach that allows for the efficient assessment of a range of cognitive abilities.

We found the same pattern here with student preferring multiple-choice tests above the simulations. This can stem from students feeling that they fail to gain understanding from the simulations opposed to multiple-choice tests, which more closely match the explicit format used in traditional teaching practices and the oral exam procedures. Thus, any implicit knowledge obtained from the simulations may be opaque to students. It is very likely that this blindness is a cultural product of our traditional semantically explicit [37] and highly exam-focused teaching traditions[17,38].\n### Input: Why might students prefer multiple-choice tests over simulations, despite evidence of learning improvement from the latter?\n### Response: Students might prefer multiple-choice tests over simulations because these tests more closely match the explicit format used in traditional teaching practices and oral exam procedures.

A considerable body of research explores how the composition of a team  or group and related factors around roles and role diversity influence open and colla - borative behaviour (Somech and Drach-Zahavy 2013 ).\n### Input: What are the key advantages of teamwork in science and how does the composition of a team or group influence open and collaborative behavior?\n### Response: The key advantages of teamwork in science include diversity, division of labour, and knowledge recombination. Diversity allows for a range of perspectives and ideas, division of labour enables tasks to be distributed according to individual strengths, and knowledge recombination allows for the integration of different types of knowledge to create new insights. The composition of a team or group can influence open and collaborative behavior. Research has shown that factors related to roles and role diversity within a team or group can impact how open and collaborative the team or group is. This could be due to the different skills, experiences, and perspectives that different team members bring, which can either enhance or hinder open and collaborative behavior.\n\n"}

R. Brown et al., 2014). Sea Hero Quest delivers a casual game experience and has reached 2.5 millionparticipants, which yielded important insights into spatial navigation impairments in adultsat risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Coutrot et al., 2018). That said, Sea Hero Quest is by designonly intended to measure spatial navigation; thus, if the goal is to measure a portfolio ofdistinct cognitive abilities, it would be a considerable effort to perform similar studies foreach cognitive ability of interest. In contrast, The Great Brain Experiment is a collectionof smaller games that assess multiple cognitive abilities. Through a large-scale deployment,the games have yielded new insights into age-related changes in working memory perfor-mance (McNab et al., 2015) and patterns of bias in information-seeking behavior (Hunt, Rut-ledge, Malalasekera, Kennerley, & Dolan, 2016). \n### Input: What are some examples of games designed for cognitive assessment and what insights have they provided into cognitive abilities and impairments?\n### Response: The text mentions two games designed for cognitive assessment: Sea Hero Quest and The Great Brain Experiment. Sea Hero Quest, which has reached 2.5 million participants, is designed to measure spatial navigation. It has provided insights into spatial navigation impairments in adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Aspects of personality and behavioral correlates  of creativity are evaluated with self-perception assess - ments such as personality scales and questionnaires  (Kaufman & Sternberg, 2019 ). Self-reporting can be use- ful in some contexts despite its vulnerability to biases  (Kaufman, 2019 ). Creativity can be assessed from obser - ving a particular activity, which is common practice in  education (Katz-Buonincontro & Anderson, 2018 ). One  can map the process toward a creative solution by record - ing verbal transcripts of thought. One commonly used  method employing this is the \u2018Think Aloud\u2019 method  (Dorst & Cross, 2001 ; Kaplan & Simon, 1990 ). However,  these are also resource intensive to manually code.\n### Input: What are some traditional testing instruments used for assessing creativity, and what are their potential limitations?\n### Response: Traditional testing instruments used for assessing creativity include self-perception assessments such as personality scales and questionnaires, observation of a particular activity, and the 'Think Aloud' method which involves recording verbal transcripts of thought. However, these methods have potential limitations. Self-reporting, for instance, can be useful in some contexts but it is vulnerable to biases. Observing a particular activity is a common practice in education, but it may not provide a comprehensive assessment of creativity. The 'Think Aloud' method, while effective, is resource-intensive as it requires manual coding.\n\n"}

However, stealth assessment hinges on the ability to \u201c(a)  define the claims concerning learners\u2019 competencies, (b)  establish what represents valid evidence of a claim, and  (c) determine the kind of tasks or situations that will elicit  that evidence \u201d (Shute et al., 2016 , p. 2). That is, the  methodology involves a thorough literature review of  the competency that one wants to assess (e.g., creativity).  The deep review of the literature serves as the basis for  crafting a multifaceted, interconnected graphical repre - sentation of creativity. As we have discussed above, realiz - ing such established construct validity is by no means  a solved problem. This underscores the general call in  this paper to not only use games to assess creativity but  also to deeper understand creativity. This could poten - tially be achieved by combining well-structured tasks  tapping into CT and DT behavior and more free open-  ended exploration such as in the final modes of crea.  blender and Physics Playground.\n### Input: What are the steps involved in the stealth assessment approach to understanding and assessing creativity in games, and how can this method be improved to better understand creativity?\n### Response: The stealth assessment approach to understanding and assessing creativity in games involves three steps. First, it requires defining the claims concerning learners' competencies. Second, it involves establishing what represents valid evidence of a claim. Third, it determines the kind of tasks or situations that will elicit that evidence. This methodology also involves a thorough literature review of the competency that one wants to assess, such as creativity. The deep review of the literature serves as the basis for crafting a multifaceted, interconnected graphical representation of creativity. \n\nTo improve this method and better understand creativity, the paper suggests not only using games to assess creativity but also to deepen the understanding of creativity. This could potentially be achieved by combining well-structured tasks that tap into convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) behavior and more free open-ended exploration such as in the final modes of creative blender and Physics Playground.\n\n"}

The NK model explicitly models adaptive evolution as a \"search in protein space\", which attempts to find a maximum point for a chosen fitness function. This means it is used to represent the process of evolution as a search for the most optimal genetic configuration, or the \"fittest\" state. This approach has been used to computationally model complex, adaptive systems in various fields.\n\n"}

Going beyond limitations imposed by traditional lab-based experiments, new efforts have been underway toward greater ecological validity and participant diversity to capture the full range of individual differences in cognitive abilities and behaviors across the general population. Building on this, we developed Skill Lab, a novel game-based tool that simultaneously assesses a broad suite of cognitive abilities while providing an engaging narrative. Skill Lab consists of six mini-games as well as 14 established cognitive ability tasks. Using a popular citizen science platform ( N=10,725), we conducted a comprehensive validation in the wild of a game-based cognitive assessment suite. Based on the game and validation task data, we constructed reliable models to simultaneously predict eight cognitive abilities based on the users\u2019 in-game behavior. Follow-up validation tests revealed that the models can discriminate nuances contained within each separate cognitive ability as well as capture a shared main factor of generalized cognitive ability. Our game-based measures are \ufb01ve times faster to complete than the equivalent task-based measures and replicate previous \ufb01ndings on the decline of certain cognitive abilities with age in our large cross-sectional population sample ( N=6369). Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid in-the-wild systematic assessment of cognitive abilities as a promising \ufb01rst step toward population-scale benchmarking and individualized mental health diagnostics.\n### Input: What is the potential impact of the Skill Lab game-based tool on personalized learning, employment practices, and precision psychiatry?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific details on the potential impact of the Skill Lab game-based tool on personalized learning, employment practices, and precision psychiatry.\n\n"}

If relevant for the point made, we asked contributors to reveal their role (e.g., facilitator, OIS user, or OIS scholar).\n### Input: What are the challenges and benefits of co-developing research proposals with collaborators from diverse backgrounds?\n### Response: The text highlights that co-developing research proposals with collaborators from diverse backgrounds brings a number of important benefits. However, it also identifies several procedural challenges. The text does not explicitly state what these benefits and challenges are, but it suggests that the diversity of collaborators' backgrounds, including the knowledge that they bring, could be both a challenge and a benefit. The text also implies that anonymity or the revealing of names could be a potential challenge in the co-development process.\n\n"}

Skill Lab as a potential cognitive diagnostics tool. One of Skill Lab\u2019s potential use cases is as a low-cost test battery that could be used to track cognitive impairments. We are, therefore, interested in the time it takes compared to current cognitive batteries. The average time taken to complete all six games was 14 min (SD =5 min), in comparison with 72 min needed to complete all the validation tasks (SD =7). In other words, the Skill Lab games could model cognitive abilities in one-fifth of the time as required by the traditional set of cognitive tests.\n### Input: What is the potential use of Skill Lab as a cognitive diagnostics tool in terms of time efficiency compared to traditional cognitive tests?\n### Response: The potential use of Skill Lab as a cognitive diagnostics tool in terms of time efficiency is that it can model cognitive abilities in one-fifth of the time required by traditional cognitive tests.

These games claim to foster and\/or assess creativity and  other 21st century skills. Examples include: KnackApp (u.  d.), Kettlemind (u.d.), Figment (u.d.), BrainSparker (u.d.),  and Lumosity (u.d.). Some of these companies charge fees  based on promises to \u201cfind hidden talent and build your  strongest workforce\u201d (KnackApp, u.d.), and encourage  people to purchase and play so they \u201cdo not get left  behind\u201d (KnackApp, u.d.) . These games provide a user  friendly \u2018creativity score\u2019 which allows one to \u2018certify\u2019 their  creativity. Very few of these describe transparent meth - odologies or any scientific documentation for their  claims, and the validity of some that do have been ser- iously questioned (Shute, Ventura, & Ke, 2015 ). Despite  their caveats, these apps maintain substantial user bases in  the tens of thousands to millions (Strobach & Kupferberg,  2020 ). This information truly highlights the imminent  need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently  documented solutions.\n### Input: What is the need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently documented solutions in assessing creativity, considering the popularity and questionable validity of current gamified platforms like KnackApp and Lumosity?\n### Response: The need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently documented solutions in assessing creativity is highlighted by the popularity and questionable validity of current gamified platforms like KnackApp and Lumosity. These platforms claim to foster and assess creativity, but often lack transparent methodologies or scientific documentation to support their claims. Despite this, they maintain substantial user bases, indicating a high demand for such services. Therefore, there is an imminent need for solutions that are not only accessible and scalable, but also scientifically valid and transparently documented to ensure the accurate assessment of creativity and other 21st century skills.\n\n"}

In an educational context games have the ability to make lear ning more entertaining and motivate students without compromising the learning (Muntean, 2011). Abstract conten t which could otherwise be incomprehensible can in games be conveyed though simple visual representations and interactions (Bj\u00e6lde et al., 2014; Magnusen et al., 2014; Pedersen et al., 2016).  The simple visual representations combined with the game elements allow students to obtain an intuition even for systems which do not have any analogies to their daily life (Lieberoth et al., 2015). Games can be designed such that students are presented with problems in an environment that allows them to make mistakes and reflect upon them. The flow-in-game infused learning can be designed to adapt to the individual students\u2019 level of skill in order to provide training in the mo st beneficial areas. Such dynamically differentiated learning (Algozzine & Anderson, 2007) is enabled by giving students, who have troubles with a specific type of problems, extra opportunities to train, while allowing those, who have mastered the problems, to proceed. Thus, students will mostly work in their zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978); continually challenged to the border of their current abilities but with scaffolds like tuto ring and feedback in place to keep the learning trajectory moving forward (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). These eleme nts align well with the visible learning theory (Hattie & Yates, 2014); the games welcome errors as learning opportun ities, the students current abilities are assessed and determine the next step in the learning process, the stud ents have a clear goal to fulfill, and the games can be built such that both teachers and students can easily follow the progress.\n### Input: What are the benefits of using games in teaching differentiation problems and how do they align with the visible learning theory?\n### Response: The benefits of using games in teaching differentiation problems include making learning more entertaining and motivating for students, conveying abstract content through simple visual representations and interactions, and allowing students to develop an intuition for complex systems. Games also provide an environment where students can make mistakes and reflect upon them, and can be designed to adapt to individual students' skill levels, providing training in the most beneficial areas. This aligns with the visible learning theory in several ways. The games welcome errors as learning opportunities, assess the students' current abilities to determine the next step in the learning process, provide a clear goal for students to fulfill, and can be designed so that both teachers and students can easily track progress.\n\n"}

Balancing these priorities, as one participant noted, proved difficult: \u201cAt about the halfway point, I was concerned that our group had focused too much on solving the problem at hand using (open and collaborative) methods with which we were already familiar and had not talked much about the OIS research gap that we hoped to close. Therefore, I made an effort to refocus our conversation in that direction.\u201d Others noted that some of these tensions arose because \u201c\u2019users\u2019 often have ideas about potential solutions\u201d and that to better balance the different foci the group needed to \u201ctake those [ideas] and think about the underlying assumptions: what construct does the \u2018user\u2019 focus on, what assumptions does s\/he have about underlying mechanisms? Then brainstorm in the team what research has to say about these and where the open questions emerge.\u201d Similarly, several groups identified that it was important to \u201clisten carefully to the OIS user. Identify and question underlying assumptions or beliefs, as well as differing incentives for the OIS user and the OIS researchers.\u201d Predictably, the proposals emerging from this intricate process (see Appendix B) have a wide range of equally valuable outcomes on a spectrum ranging from basic to applied research (Stokes 1997, see also Schauz 2014 on the uncertain status of this distinction).\n### Input: What are the challenges and potential solutions in balancing immediate problem-solving and identifying underlying research gaps in the co-development process?\n### Response: The challenges in balancing immediate problem-solving and identifying underlying research gaps in the co-development process include the tension between the desire to solve immediate problems, often by the users, and the need to identify relevant research gaps that could inspire new problem spaces. This tension can lead to an overemphasis on immediate problem-solving using familiar methods, at the expense of addressing the research gap. \n\nPotential solutions to these challenges include refocusing the conversation towards the research gap, questioning the underlying assumptions of the users' proposed solutions, and carefully listening to the users to identify and question their underlying assumptions or beliefs. It is also important to consider the differing incentives for the users and the researchers. Brainstorming in the team about what research has to say about these assumptions and where the open questions emerge can also help balance the different foci.\n\n"}

Many such advanced approaches focus on capturing failures of the stand-alone AI system by querying humans for feedback about a certain selection of the AI predictions (Kamar and Manikonda 2017, Nushi et al. 2018).

Policymakers as co-creators in the scientific research process. Besides the public  and industry actors, policymakers at various levels of government also collaborate with  scientists. Traditionally, the engagement of policymakers in scientific research has been  defined by the setting of science and innovation policies. Government institutions  directly fund research and are thus inevitably involved in influencing research directions  (Gl\u00e4ser and Laudel 2016 ). In defining research policies, policymakers are charged with  interpreting the priorities of a variety of stakeholders in the relevant polity, including  citizens, industry actors, other government agencies, and scientists themselves. Although  the steering of science along these lines is significant, its impact on research is mediated  in various ways. These steering actions are generally either conducted through funding  schemes, on which scientists in different fields may depend more or less heavily, or  through requirements for educational institutions, which are increasingly managed by  professional administrators and have policy agendas of their own (Huisman and Seeber  2019 ). Of course, scientists themselves also play a role in influencing the form these  steering actions take.\n### Input: What role do policymakers play in the scientific research process and how do they influence research directions?\n### Response: Policymakers play a crucial role in the scientific research process by setting science and innovation policies.

This has consequences for the long-term dynamics of the system, which may not be adequately represented by epistasis measures.\n\n"}

Well designed, human-centered AI solutions augment humans by bringing them more intimately into-the-loop (Christiano et al., 2017; Dellermann et al., 2019; Michelucci and Dickinson, 2016; Schneiderman, 2020). Initial steps in this direction include capturing failures of the stand-alone AI system by querying humans for feedback about a certain selection of predictions made by an algorithm (Kamar and Manikonda, 2017; Nushi et al., 2018). \n### Input: What are some initial steps taken towards designing human-centered AI solutions in Citizen Science projects?\n### Response: The initial steps towards designing human-centered AI solutions in Citizen Science projects include capturing failures of the stand-alone AI system by querying humans for feedback about a certain selection of predictions made by an algorithm.\n\n"}

First, scholars participating in this project have unique approaches towards  and experiences with openness and collaboration in science, which allowed us to avoid overstating  generalisability or misaligning potentially incompatible concepts. Given our diversity, we sought to  align and balance the different literature streams rather than imposing one dominant logic. Second,  different scientific fields across the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences have different  norms regarding the intensity and scope of different types of open and collaborative practices. These  divergences informed the entire process, from conceptualising the framework to identifying the  literature informing the antecedents, contingencies, outcomes, and impacts of OIS practices, to  writing this article. The open and constructive attitude of the co-authors made it possible to identify  and resolve conflicting (often tacit) assumptions. \n### Input: What are the three reasons that make the collaborative approach well-suited to the project despite the challenges?\n### Response: The three reasons that make the collaborative approach well-suited to the project despite the challenges are: \n\n1) The unique approaches and experiences of the scholars participating in the project towards openness and collaboration in science, which helped avoid overstating generalisability or misaligning potentially incompatible concepts. \n\n2) The different norms regarding the intensity and scope of different types of open and collaborative practices across various scientific fields, including the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. \n\n3) The open and constructive attitude of the co-authors, which enabled the identification and resolution of conflicting (often tacit) assumptions.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: With such impact comes the need for respon sible research and innovation (RRI) in QST [102], where narrative is of great importance in conveying dimensions such as diver-sity and equality, openness, and public engagement. For example, Quantum Technologies are expected to revolutionise the job market, where there is already critical under-repre-sentation of women [103] and minorities [104] in scientific careers. Outreach offers an op-portunity to take crucial steps towards equality and inclusion. Thus, the narrative should highlight success stories of women and othe r under-represented minorities contributing to and leading the development of quantum te chnologies. Inspirational stories along these lines should make evident that such under-repre sentation is purely an artefact of society, and not a barrier to the next generation of female and minority scientists. Furthermore, specialist knowledge should be openly accessi ble to the broad scientific community, citi- zens, and policy makers. Participatory [105] and citizen science tools may be a powerful means of public engagement which are capabl e of interweaving the experiences of these groups.  \n### Input: What role does responsible research and innovation (RRI) play in promoting diversity, equality, and public engagement in Quantum Science and Technology (QST)?\n### Response: Responsible research and innovation (RRI) plays a significant role in promoting diversity, equality, and public engagement in Quantum Science and Technology (QST) by emphasizing the importance of narrative. This narrative should highlight the contributions and leadership of under-represented minorities, such as women, in the development of quantum technologies. This can help to challenge societal biases and inspire the next generation of female and minority scientists. RRI also promotes openness, suggesting that specialist knowledge should be accessible to all, including the broader scientific community, citizens, and policy makers. Tools such as participatory and citizen science can be used to engage the public and interweave their experiences with the scientific community.\n\n"}

Since our findings are based on measurements of cognitive abilities, we speculate that individuals with greater variation in cognitive abilities are more likely to identify a better match to entrepreneurship, where they themselves have the autonomy to define their functions48. Integrating data on lower-level cognitive abilities thus challenges the Jack-of-all-trade theory\u2019s distinction between generalists vs. specialists, which expands our insights into the characteristics of entrepreneurs.\n### Input: How does integrating data on lower-level cognitive abilities challenge the Jack-of-all-trade theory\u2019s distinction between generalists vs. specialists in the context of entrepreneurship?\n### Response: The integration of data on lower-level cognitive abilities challenges the Jack-of-all-trade theory\u2019s distinction between generalists vs. specialists in the context of entrepreneurship by suggesting that individuals with greater variation in cognitive abilities are more likely to find a better match in entrepreneurship. This implies that it's not just about being a generalist or a specialist, but rather having a diverse range of cognitive skills that can be applied flexibly, which is a characteristic of entrepreneurs. This expands our understanding of what it means to be an entrepreneur beyond the traditional generalist vs. specialist dichotomy.\n\n"}

If the correct set visually looked closer to the target than alternatives they were put in the easy category; if all sets had similar components to the target set, they were put in the hard category. The appropriate level of difficulty is important as tasks that are too easy would taint construct validity and lead to ceiling effect, and tasks too hard would frustrate players, possibly causing them to leave. I welcome advice on balancing methodological stringency with optimal support of player engagement. In later stages, convergent validity of the CT mode will be measured by comparing to the Remote Association Test [ 35] which I hope to also later include in CREA. \n### Input: What factors are considered when choosing images for the blender in the game, and why is the appropriate level of difficulty important?\n### Response: The factors considered when choosing images for the blender in the game include the shapes and colors of the source image sets and the target images. The images are chosen based on how closely they visually resemble the target. The appropriate level of difficulty is important because tasks that are too easy could taint construct validity and lead to a ceiling effect, while tasks that are too hard could frustrate players and potentially cause them to leave the game. Balancing methodological stringency with optimal support of player engagement is crucial.\n\n"}

To be included in the validation process, a player had to complete at least one specific combination of tasks measuring a given cognitive ability (e.g., the three tasks Visual Pattern, Groton Maze, and Corsi Block had to be completed in order for us to evaluate the ability Visuospatial Working Memory). Even with these requirements, we obtained a larger sample of wild players for the cognitive ability measures than from MTurk (Fig. 2c). MTurk participants often sacrifice accuracy for speedy task completion. We found that this was not the case for wild players (see Supplementary Information). The games were specifically developed to motivate players to do their best, and it is faster to complete all the games combined (14 \u00b1 5 min) than all the cognitive ability tasks combined (72 \u00b1 7 min). Thus, the games could potentially be used for rapid cognitive assessments.\n### Input: What percentage of players who played the app version of the game completed at least one cognitive ability task?\n### Response: The percentage of players who played the app version of the game and completed at least one cognitive ability task is 38%.\n\n"}

Some of these groups work in related research areas but do not share knowledge with each other. The Problem Pitcher believes that knowledge sharing would save time and resources, e.g., by avoiding duplication of research efforts. Currently, decisions about the strategic direction of research groups and collaboration with other groups are made by project leaders. The pitcher believes that involving a broader range of group members (including junior members such as postdocs) would lead to more support for openness, e.g., because junior members are less concerned about competition between groups or may even see personal benefits from collaboration and sharing. \n### Input: How can CERN encourage more knowledge sharing between different research groups and promote a more inclusive decision-making process that involves junior members such as postdocs?\n### Response: CERN can encourage more knowledge sharing between different research groups and promote a more inclusive decision-making process by implementing the following strategies:\n\n1. Establishing a Knowledge Sharing Platform: CERN can create an online platform where all research groups can share their findings, methodologies, and resources. This platform can be accessible to all members, including junior members, promoting transparency and collaboration.\n\n2. Regular Inter-Group Meetings: CERN can organize regular meetings where different research groups present their work and discuss their strategies. This will not only foster knowledge sharing but also help identify potential areas of collaboration.\n\n3. Inclusive Decision-Making Process: CERN can involve junior members in decision-making processes by creating committees that include representatives from all levels of the organization. These committees can be tasked with making decisions about research directions and collaborations.\n\n4. Mentorship Programs: Senior members can mentor junior members, encouraging them to share their ideas and contribute to decision-making processes. This can also help junior members understand the value of collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n5. Recognition and Rewards: CERN can introduce a system of recognition and rewards for those who actively participate in knowledge sharing and collaborative activities. This can motivate all members to contribute more actively.\n\n6. Training and Workshops: CERN can conduct training sessions and workshops on the importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration. These sessions can also equip members with the necessary skills to effectively share knowledge and collaborate with others.\n\n7. Open-Source Culture: Promoting an open-source culture where research findings are freely available can also encourage knowledge sharing. This can be achieved by publishing research in open-access journals and sharing data and resources openly. \n\n8. Encouraging Interdisciplinary Research: By promoting interdisciplinary research, CERN can encourage different research groups to work together, fostering knowledge sharing and collaboration. \n\nBy implementing these strategies, CERN can foster a culture of knowledge sharing and inclusivity, leading to more efficient and innovative research.\n\n"}

These projects motivate players by framing the game as an entertaining method to contribute to a meaningful scientific question12,13. Sea Hero Quest has reached 2.5 million participants and yielded important insights into spatial navigation impairments in adults at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease14; The Great Brain Experiment has provided new insights into age-related changes in working memory performance15 and patterns of bias in information-seeking behavior16. These studies have demonstrated the viability of large-scale cognitive ability testing11, but have relied on small, laboratory-based validation samples of their gamified cognitive ability measures. This raises an important question: Can we advance crowdsourced psychological science by motivating large groups of players to both play the games and perform the less entertaining and more time-consuming traditional tasks in order to provide a robust within-subject validation of game-based cognitive ability measures?\n### Input: Can large-scale cognitive ability testing be advanced by motivating large groups of players to engage in both entertaining games and more time-consuming traditional tasks, in order to provide a robust within-subject validation of game-based cognitive ability measures?\n### Response: The text suggests this as a question, but does not provide a definitive answer. It highlights the success of projects like Sea Hero Quest and The Great Brain Experiment in gathering large-scale cognitive ability data, but also notes that these studies have relied on small, laboratory-based validation samples. Therefore, it remains an open question whether motivating large groups of players to engage in both games and traditional tasks can advance large-scale cognitive ability testing.\n\n"}

These sit in the body  of the DC, where the narrative focuses next. Here is where the conceptual understanding and formalistic thinking that is unique to the field is most benefitted, with participants able to address its core features. Traditionally, scientists work within this part of the framework for the majority of their time. However, what drives curiosity the most is not working with what is known and understood, but grappling with what is not. Indeed, this is inhe rent in the nature of scientific thinking as knowledge-seeking. As such, our narrative requires the audience to return to the limita- tions of their understanding, in the peripher y. Observations are once again made without formal models which can yet describe them.\n### Input: What role does the exploration of unknown concepts play in the process of scientific thinking and knowledge-seeking?\n### Response: The exploration of unknown concepts plays a crucial role in the process of scientific thinking and knowledge-seeking. It drives curiosity and pushes scientists to grapple with what is not yet known or understood. This exploration requires scientists to return to the limitations of their understanding and make observations without the aid of formal models that can describe them. This process is inherent in the nature of scientific thinking as it seeks to expand knowledge and understanding.\n\n"}

Scientists\u2019 individual background and characteristics. Beyond personal choice, scientists\u2019 education and prior experience appear to influence the application of OIS practices like founding science-based start-ups. For example, company founders with a PhD are more likely to adopt Open Science strategies (Ding 2011 ). Unsurprisingly, researchers who have entrepreneurial experience are more likely to start a new firm (Abreu and Grinevich 2013 ; Shane and Khurana 2003 ). Similarly, researchers with an interdisciplinary career trajectory and work experience in industry are likely to have higher patent productivity (Abreu and Grinevich 2013 ; Dietz and Bozeman 2005 ). Scientists are also more likely to have entrepreneurial intentions if they have a more diverse and balanced skill set, but only if they are in contact with entrepreneurial peers (Lazear 2004 ; Moog et al. 2015 ). Another characteristic identified as a driver of open and collaborative behaviour is individuallevel absorptive capacity \u2013 that is, the ability to 148 S. BECK ET AL.\n### Input: What factors influence a scientist's likelihood to adopt Open Science strategies and start science-based start-ups?\n### Response: The factors that influence a scientist's likelihood to adopt Open Science strategies and start science-based start-ups include their education and prior experience. Scientists with a PhD are more likely to adopt Open Science strategies. Those with entrepreneurial experience, an interdisciplinary career trajectory, and work experience in the industry are more likely to start a new firm and have higher patent productivity. Scientists with a diverse and balanced skill set are more likely to have entrepreneurial intentions, especially if they are in contact with entrepreneurial peers. Individual-level absorptive capacity, or the ability to absorb and apply new knowledge, is also a driver of open and collaborative behavior.\n\n"}

Another stream of literature has focused on a particular subset of health and social service users, namely vulnerable users. This stream of literature, e.g., describes key characteristics of vulnerable users, discusses ethical issues in research on vulnerable populations, and provides guidelines for undertaking research on and engaging with vulnerable or disadvantaged participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been limited efforts in the literature on user involvement to specifically address how vulnerable users may be involved as active participants in research processes. Vulnerable users are particularly likely to be at risk of negative experiences when being involved in research. Some vulnerable users, e.g., from low-income backgrounds, may be particularly lacking in prerequisites for contributing to academic research processes. Moreover, vulnerable users who participate in research processes may have to interact with professional users with whom they interact on a day-to-day basis, in a situation characterized by power differentials. Finally, vulnerable users are particularly difficult to reach and engage in research processes and may be negatively affected by stigma, perhaps associated with some of the very traits that make them relevant users to involve in a study.\n### Input: What strategies can be implemented to effectively involve vulnerable users as active participants in research processes, considering the potential negative experiences, power differentials, and stigma they may face?\n### Response: The text does not provide information on the strategies that can be implemented to effectively involve vulnerable users as active participants in research processes.\n\n"}

A different intuition about how evolutionary dynamics might be influenced by the underlying fitness function emerges from models that consider the possibility that some solutions have equal fitness. WZ_his was fueled by developments in molecular biology, which have questioned the \u201crugged landscape\u201d metaphor, in particular its explanation of speciation [56, 57]. WZ_his work was largely driven by the neutral theory of molecular evolution and in particular the observation that the majority of mutations at a molecular level do not affect the phenotype [18,58].\n### Input: What is the neutral theory of molecular evolution and how does it challenge the \"rugged landscape\" metaphor in evolutionary dynamics?\n### Response: The text does not provide a detailed explanation of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. However, it mentions that this theory is based on the observation that the majority of mutations at a molecular level do not affect the phenotype. This challenges the \"rugged landscape\" metaphor in evolutionary dynamics, which focuses on the distinction between smooth and rugged landscapes and how to measure ruggedness.

Spinouts are popular among policymakers, due to the belief that they are effective vehicles for advancing the industrial application of scientific knowledge and, simultaneously, creating jobs and growth (e.g. Carayannis et al. 1998 ; Druilhe and Garnsey 2003 ; Rasmussen and Wright 2015 ). Nonetheless, studies show that spinouts are highly prone to failure, have little impact on local or regional economic development (Mustar, Wright, and Clarysse 2008 ), and grow less than other high-tech companies (Ensley and Hmieleski 2005 ). As a result, many research organisations have shifted their focus from maximising the number of created spinouts to strengthening potential value creation and emphasising their own role in research dissemination (Jacob, Lundqvist, and Hellsmark 2003 ; Moray and Clarysse 2005 ; Wright et al. 2006 ).\n### Input: What are some of the challenges and limitations associated with spinouts according to various studies?\n### Response: According to various studies, spinouts face several challenges and limitations.

Thus, we built a 3D simulation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment (SGE), which is central to the course, because it illustrates the counterintuitive quantum effects appearing when a spin is measured along orthogonal axes[30]. The simulation was built in the Unity development environment and hosted in a specific lesson in Student Researcher. The simulation displayed a stream of particles in a 50-50 mixture of the spin-up and spin-down states going through up to three sets of rotatable magnets (Fig.2). Each set of magnets altered the path of each particle based on the spin. If a screen was placed after a set of magnets, the spin of the particles could be determined. Simulations of the SGE enable students to apply the theory in a spatial setting, and highlight the statistical nature of quantum physics[29,31]. FIG. 1. Left: Content priority for Student Researcher.

This is because human problem-solvers are not constrained to engaging in small, incremental changes, as suggested by the one-bit-flip conception.\n\n"}

Model generalizability with data from computer version The analysis above only considered the players on the mobile devices as the interface differences to computers could affect the measurement of the cognitive abilities (Drucker et al., 2013; Muender et al., 2019; Watson et al., 2013). However, if the accepted models that we have trained on the data from the mobile devices represent a mapping between cognitive abilities and game indicators, then applying them on the data collected from players of the computer version will provide a test of the generalizability. To account for systematic interface differences, we standardized the game and task indicators anew with only the computer data. We then computed the cognitive abilities from the task indicators for all the players who had taken the right combinations and correlated them with the predicted cognitive abilities from the models trained on mobile data (Table 4). \n### Input: What method was used to test the generalizability of the models trained on data from mobile devices in the context of computer version data?\n### Response: The method used to test the generalizability of the models trained on data from mobile devices in the context of computer version data was to apply these models on the data collected from players of the computer version.

We examine this within the con- text of the ongoing crea.visions research project, which employs AI technologies to visualize citizens\u2019 visions of the future. Our find- ings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as: 1) the tool\u2019s dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhance- ment of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limita- tions related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts. This study serves as a foundation for future research on AI-assisted image generation as a resource in creative problem- solving, laying the groundwork for the creation of increasingly effective and user-friendly tools. \n### Input: What are the factors contributing to the effectiveness of AI-assisted visualization in the problem identification and construction phase of the creative problem-solving process?\n### Response: The factors contributing to the effectiveness of AI-assisted visualization in the problem identification and construction phase of the creative problem-solving process include the tool's dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, the enhancement of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and the facilitation of idea communication.\n\n"}

Introduction One of the greatest challenges facing our \u201csociety of acceleration and uncertainty\u201d [ 1] is the need for resources to tackle the problems which arise from scienti\ufb01c and techno- logical advancement, such as climate change and information management [ 2]. The most sustainable form of resources are people [ 3]: a population nurtured with the skills needed to navigate and support an ever-changing world. Educated citizens can contribute to science themselves, by employment in research, through citizen science methodologies [ 4], and through policy making [ 5]. Equally, such skills are necessary for them to be effective, ef\ufb01cient, and creative problem solvers in their own employment or social context [2].\n### Input: What role do educated citizens play in contributing to science and problem-solving in the context of scientific and technological advancement?\n### Response: Educated citizens contribute to science and problem-solving in the context of scientific and technological advancement in several ways. They can contribute directly to science through employment in research and through citizen science methodologies. They can also influence science and technology policy making. Additionally, the skills they acquire through education enable them to be effective, efficient, and creative problem solvers in their own employment or social context.\n\n"}

Assessing the models\u2019 predictive power 4.3.1. Generalized cognitive ability Since the cognitive abilities are related in the theoretical framework (Fig. 1), it is essential to look at shared variation contributing to the observed predictive power. Therefore, we performed a pair of exploratory factor analyses, one on the cognitive abilities computed from validation tasks, and one on cognitive abilities predicted from game data. This allowed us to identify the main factor in both sets, interpretable as a generalized cognitive ability (Knopik et al., 2017).\n### Input: What method was used to assess the shared variation contributing to the predictive power of the cognitive abilities models?\n### Response: The method used to assess the shared variation contributing to the predictive power of the cognitive abilities models was a pair of exploratory factor analyses.\n\n"}

These are usually built on (and reinforce) strong personal and informal relations between individuals (e.g. Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2002 ; Feller and Feldman 2010 ; Grimpe and Fier 2010 ). Direct collaboration can stimulate \u2018bench-level\u2019 relationships between individual researchers and industry partners, and thus help to foster mutually meaningful exchanges (e.g. in the form of learning or access to in-kind resources) (D\u2019Este and Perkmann 2011 ).

Another form that (interdisciplinary) scientific  collaboration takes is the sharing of intermediate research products. The ability to build  on existing knowledge depends on access not only to published findings, but also to  underlying data and materials such as cells and cultures used in prior research (e.g.  Andreoli-Versbach and Mueller-Langer 2014 ; Czarnitzki, Grimpe, and Pellens 2015 ;  Furman and Stern 2011 ; Mokyr 2002 ). Data sharing is thus an essential backstop for  the scientific principles of credibility and replication, allowing researchers to build more  quickly on prior work and allowing data sharers to achieve more visibility and impact  (Beck et al. 2019 ; Chan et al. 2019 ; Hossain, Dwivedi, and Rana 2016 ; Nature editorial  2018 ; Woelfle, Olliaro, and Todd 2011 ; Czarnitzki, Grimpe, and Pellens 2015 ; Borgman  2015 ). There are two primary paths for data sharing: voluntary data sharing via private  communication and public repositories (e.g. archives, federated data networks, virtual  observatories), and mandatory data disclosure in response to policies by journals (Rousi  and Laakso 2020 ) and funders (Andreoli-Versbach and Mueller-Langer 2014 ). \n### Input: What are the two primary paths for data sharing in scientific research and how do they contribute to the principles of credibility and replication?\n### Response: The two primary paths for data sharing in scientific research are voluntary data sharing via private communication and public repositories, and mandatory data disclosure in response to policies by journals and funders. These paths contribute to the principles of credibility and replication by providing access to underlying data and materials used in prior research. This allows researchers to build more quickly on prior work and enables data sharers to achieve more visibility and impact. Furthermore, data sharing serves as an essential backstop for these scientific principles, ensuring that the findings can be verified and replicated by other researchers.\n\n"}

The limitations of current \u201cself-learning\u201d AI is highlighted by the, perhaps surprising, fact that AlphaZero has so far hardly found application beyond the realm of games (Dalgaard et al. 2020, Toma\u0161ev et al. 2020). One goal of AI research is therefore to better understand what makes tasks unsolvable by current algorithms, and find alternative or complementary methods.\n### Input: What are the limitations of current \"self-learning\" AI and how can AI research work towards understanding and solving tasks that are currently unsolvable by these algorithms?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific details on the limitations of current \"self-learning\" AI. However, it implies that these AI systems may struggle with complex and dynamic multi-actor environments, as evidenced by the need for human gameplay learning in the development of the AI for Starcraft. The text also suggests that current \"self-learning\" AI like AlphaZero has limited application beyond games. To address these limitations, the text suggests that AI research should aim to better understand what makes certain tasks unsolvable by current algorithms and explore alternative or complementary methods.\n\n"}

For instance, the practice of pre-registering hypotheses and\/or research designs stands to increase reliability by distinguishing between tested and retroactive predictions (known as \u2018p-hacking\u2019 when used to cherry-pick statistically significant effects) that may gloss over negative results (Nosek et al. 2018 ; Yamada 2018 ). However, research on innovation contests shows that making ideas public at an early stage risks generating many similar ideas and stifling creativity (Wooten and Ulrich 2015 ). Likewise, increased team sizes may promote novelty through knowledge recombination, but \u2018too collaborative behaviours\u2019 may also distort team dynamics leading to citation farming and other forms of research misconduct (Seeber et al. 2019 ; Walsh, Lee, and Tang 2019 ). In the realm of scientific publishing, the article processing charge (APC) model of open access has opened the door to so-called predatory journals, which imitate legitimate titles but fail to provide a thorough review process. Researchers may unwittingly submit to journals like these without verifying their reputability or even do so strategically in pursuit of an easy publication (Dobusch and Heimst\u00e4dt 2019 ; Sorokowski et al. 2017 ). Negative impacts like these are not necessarily inherent to openness and collaboration, but reflect interdependencies with other aspects of the science system that demand to be addressed.\n### Input: What are some potential negative impacts of applying open and collaborative practices in science?\n### Response: Some potential negative impacts of applying open and collaborative practices in science include the risk of generating many similar ideas and stifling creativity when ideas are made public at an early stage, distortion of team dynamics leading to citation farming and other forms of research misconduct due to 'too collaborative behaviours', and the rise of predatory journals due to the article processing charge (APC) model of open access. These journals imitate legitimate titles but fail to provide a thorough review process, leading researchers to unwittingly submit to them without verifying their reputability or even do so strategically in pursuit of an easy publication.\n\n"}

This feature of scientific knowledge production has received comparatively little attention within the OS research field. However, open and collaborative approaches at earlier stages of the scientific research process are increasingly being discussed, suggesting an evolution and expansion of OS priorities (Beck et al. 2019; Chan et al. 2019; Hossain, Dwivedi, and Rana 2016; Nature editorial 2018; Woelfle, Olliaro, and Todd 2011).\n### Input: What is the current trend in the scientific research process regarding open and collaborative approaches, and how does it suggest an evolution and expansion of Open Science priorities?\n### Response: The current trend in the scientific research process is increasingly discussing open and collaborative approaches at earlier stages. This suggests an evolution and expansion of Open Science (OS) priorities as it indicates a shift from the traditional closed processes of scientific discovery to more inclusive and participatory methods. This could potentially lead to a broader engagement in science, fostering innovation and accelerating scientific discovery.\n\n"}

In another landmark study, Mason and Watts[69] find that empirical data of search behavior deviate significantly from current models of search. This seems to be in part due to the individual\u2019s ability to exploit local spatial correlations in the landscape [69]. Thus, while the myopic search argument due to cognitive limitations is appealing, it is ultimately the individuals not \u201corganizations\u201d that engage in any kind of behavior (as microfoundations literature is trying to remind us). So, ultimately, it appears problematic to consider archetypical one-bit flips. The challenge outlined above is not limited to a nonhierarchical NK landscape but can also be extended to a hierarchical search environment.\n### Input: What are the findings of Mason and Watts' study on search behavior and how does it relate to the concept of myopic search due to cognitive limitations?\n### Response: Mason and Watts' study on search behavior found that empirical data significantly deviates from current models of search. This deviation seems to be partly due to an individual's ability to exploit local spatial correlations in the landscape. This finding challenges the concept of myopic search due to cognitive limitations, which suggests that individuals or organizations are limited in their search capabilities due to cognitive constraints. The study suggests that individuals are capable of more complex search behaviors than the myopic search model allows for.\n\n"}

In other words  some game tasks may tap into both convergent and  divergent processes. Generally speaking, games with  an emphasis on solving concrete challenges with  a well-defined correct solution seem to lend them - selves well to capturing the CT process (selection of  and iteration on correct solutions). This is particularly  relevant as developing a robust, and non-verbal  assessment for CT is one of the bigger challenges in  the field. Notably, CT was under-explored compared  to DT in the reviewed games: two games assessing CT  (Howell & Veale, 2009 ; Rafner et al., 2020 ) versus nine  explicitly assessing DT (Ali et al., 2019 ; Chuang et al.,  2015 ; Gal et al., 2017 ; Hart et al., 2017 ; Krebs et al.,  2020 ; Rafner et al., 2020 ; Rozenkrantz et al., 2017 ; CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL  41\n### Input: What challenges exist in developing a robust, non-verbal assessment for Convergent Thinking (CT) in game-based creativity assessments, and how does this compare to the assessment of Divergent Thinking (DT)?\n### Response: The text suggests that one of the main challenges in developing a robust, non-verbal assessment for Convergent Thinking (CT) in game-based creativity assessments is distinguishing between CT and Divergent Thinking (DT) based on task performance. This is because some game tasks may tap into both convergent and divergent processes. Games that emphasize solving concrete challenges with a well-defined correct solution seem to be more suitable for capturing the CT process. However, the text also notes that CT has been under-explored compared to DT in the reviewed games, with only two games assessing CT versus nine explicitly assessing DT.\n\n"}

Discussion: The Culturo-Scienti\ufb01c Narrative in QST Given the signi\ufb01cance of the choice of storytelling for QST, the inherent impact of the narrative follows, as the resulting technologies will have such an enormous impact on society [ 94]. Their engineering opens the way to simulate pharmacological interactions and create customised therapies [ 95], or to produce more ef\ufb01cient fertilisers that are less pollut- ing than is currently possible [ 96]. Materials will be developed capable of capturing and transforming carbon dioxide emissions [ 97]. Numerous other transformations will come in the \ufb01elds of telecommunications, arti\ufb01cial intelligence, and information sciences [15]. These technologies stem from different sciences, such as physics, biology, medicine, computer science, and engineering. They will have profound implications felt beyond traditional boundaries, in \ufb01elds such as economics [ 98], judicial sciences [ 99], and phi- losophy [ 100]. Their effect on our everyday life can be predicted to be signi\ufb01cant, from the manner in which we manage our health and education, to how we communicate and store information [ 15].\n### Input: What are some potential societal impacts of the technologies resulting from Quantum Science and Technology (QST), as discussed in the Culturo-Scientific Narrative?\n### Response: The potential societal impacts of the technologies resulting from Quantum Science and Technology (QST) are vast. They could lead to the simulation of pharmacological interactions and the creation of customised therapies, potentially revolutionising the field of medicine. They could also result in the production of more efficient, less polluting fertilisers, impacting agriculture and the environment. New materials capable of capturing and transforming carbon dioxide emissions could be developed, contributing to the fight against climate change. The technologies could also bring about transformations in telecommunications, artificial intelligence, and information sciences. Beyond traditional boundaries, these technologies could have profound implications in fields such as economics, judicial sciences, and philosophy. They could significantly affect everyday life, influencing how we manage our health and education, and how we communicate and store information.\n\n"}

The \ufb01rst class of resources are those able to implement forms of experimental obser- vation and\/or hypothesis development and testing. For this, virtual labs [ 79\u201382] can be best suited to the learning outcomes of university and high-school students. Quantum games [ 83\u201385], such as those produced in game jams [ 86,87] can be preferred during activi- ties limited in time or devoted to younger ages, to provide an operational approach focused around the more basic concepts. Although not currently in existence for QST, virtual and augmented reality-based simulations may also serve this need well. The creative induction of understanding and the formulation of new concepts can bene\ufb01t from animations [ 88,89] and other resources supporting immersive visualisation, such as comics [ 90] and art-science installations [ 91]. Finally, tools that can support and complement forms of formal literacy in QST are conceptual labs [ 79,92] and quantum algorithms such as the Qiskit environ- ment [ 93]. Particularly valuable in generating engagement are games such as Quantum Odyssey [94], able to provide experiences in which algorithms can be implemented in a fun and immersive environment. These \u201ctoolboxes\u201d of existing resources able to support the disciplinary literacies of QST are shown below in Figure 3. An example of the application of culturo-scienti\ufb01c storytelling in QST is currently being studied in a series of workshops for high school students based around the Quantum Jungle [ 93], an art-science exhibition which functions as a tactile visualisation of the time evolution of a single quantum particle. \n### Input: What are some examples of resources that can support and complement forms of formal literacy in Quantum Science and Technology (QST)?\n### Response: Some examples of resources that can support and complement forms of formal literacy in Quantum Science and Technology (QST) include conceptual labs, quantum algorithms such as the Qiskit environment, and games like Quantum Odyssey.\n\n"}

The Four P framework, which has often been used to distinguish factors in CPS [ 8], characterizes creativity from the perspective of the Person, Product, Process, and Press (environ- ment) [ 13]. However, when AI is involved in problem identification and construction, we must consider the \"human-AI system\" as a whole, rather than focusing solely on the person. Kantasalo and Takala [ 9] proposed the Five C framework, which shifts the focus to the creative human\u2013computer process, defined through Collective, Collaboration, Contributions, Community, and Context, offering a more comprehensive perspective on human-AI creativity. We therefore employ the Five C framework to scaffold our thematic analysis in this study.\n### Input: What is the Five C framework proposed by Kantasalo and Takala for understanding human-AI creativity?\n### Response: The Five C framework proposed by Kantasalo and Takala for understanding human-AI creativity shifts the focus to the creative human-computer process. It is defined through five components: Collective, Collaboration, Contributions, Community, and Context. This framework offers a more comprehensive perspective on human-AI creativity compared to traditional creativity frameworks.\n\n"}

The sharing of research data and protocols has led some fields to diagnose and begin responding to a so-called replication crisis (Open Science Collaboration 2015 ). Even in fields where replication may not be valued or possible, parallel logics of transparency and reflexivity are being articulated in terms of local cultures of evidence (e.g. Elman, Kapiszewski, and Lupia 2018 ).\n### Input: What is the replication crisis in scientific research and how has the application of Open Information Science (OIS) practices contributed to addressing this issue?\n### Response: The text does not provide a specific definition of the replication crisis in scientific research. However, it suggests that it is a problem identified in some fields where the results of studies are not consistently reproducible, which can undermine the reliability of scientific knowledge. The application of Open Information Science (OIS) practices has contributed to addressing this issue by promoting the sharing of research data and protocols. This increased transparency allows for greater scrutiny of research methods and findings, which can help identify and correct issues that may be contributing to the replication crisis.\n\n"}

For example in Foldit, machine agents can assist the participant in the solution of the task in two different ways: first, systematically optimizing a participant\u2019s solution with \u201csmall tweaks\u201d, using an optimization algorithm initiated by the participant (Cooper et al. 2010, pp. 756). Secondly, the Foldit software assists the participant by continuously calculating a variety of assessment criteria for the protein that the participant is currently folding, and thus through continuous feedback providing the participant with additional information (Kleiner et al. 2017, pp. 2765\u20132766). Similarly, in Quantum Moves 2, players can engage a local optimizer starting from their \u201chand drawn\u201d solution. It has been demonstrated that in some complex problems, the combination of such human seeding with machine optimisation can provide superior results to that of the individual machine agents (Jensen et al. 2021).\n### Input: What are the two ways in which machine agents assist participants in the solution of tasks in Foldit, and how does this combination of human and machine interaction provide superior results in complex problems like Quantum Moves 2?\n### Response: Machine agents assist participants in the solution of tasks in Foldit in two ways. First, they optimize a participant\u2019s solution with small tweaks using an optimization algorithm initiated by the participant. Second, the Foldit software assists the participant by continuously calculating a variety of assessment criteria for the protein that the participant is currently folding, providing the participant with additional information through continuous feedback.\n\nIn complex problems like Quantum Moves 2, this combination of human and machine interaction provides superior results. Players can engage a local optimizer starting from their hand-drawn solution. The combination of human seeding with machine optimization has been shown to provide superior results compared to individual machine agents. This is because humans can provide creative and intuitive solutions, while machines can refine these solutions with precise calculations and optimizations.\n\n"}

Examining the distributions obtained from the games across ages, we observed the expected increase in all cognitive abilities from age 16 to 20 years, followed by a gradual decline from age 20 years, which provides further support for the validity of Skill Lab as an assessment tool. This dataset may serve as a normative benchmark for future applications, not only within psychology but also for the social sciences, clinical applications, and education. These finely stratified age norms will be of particular importance when Skill Lab is used to address questions that require age-based controls. In addition, we can extract key indicators such as age of onset of decline and crossing of the general population average, which can then be applied directly in clinical and other settings. We use the age-stratified norms of the cognitive abilities to control for age effects in all the following analyses.\n### Input: What are the potential applications of the Danish population dataset obtained from the Skill Lab assessment tool?\n### Response: The potential applications of the Danish population dataset obtained from the Skill Lab assessment tool include serving as a normative benchmark for future applications within psychology, social sciences, clinical applications, and education.

Diffusion models work by gradually corrupting training data with Gaussian noise and training a neural network to reverse the process, synthesizing high-fidelity images [ 2,5]. These diffusion models often outper- form GANs in terms of image quality. Text-to-image generation serves as the primary mode of user interaction for diffusion model platforms like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney 2, whereas many GAN systems employ sliders to enable users to control image generation. The development of these technologies has greatly expanded the potential of human-AI co-creative technology for image generation and improved user accessibility.\n### Input: What are the primary modes of user interaction for diffusion model platforms and GAN systems in AI-assisted image generation technologies?\n### Response: The primary mode of user interaction for diffusion model platforms in AI-assisted image generation technologies is text-to-image generation. For GAN systems, many employ sliders to enable users to control image generation.\n\n"}

Citizen science has recently gained particular importance in this context (e.g., Hakley et al. 2021), and the degree of involvement can range from tasks such as data collection to full involvement in research design (Sauermann et al. 2020, Franzoni & Sauermann 2014). There are two specific approaches or views explaining the rationale of engaging with citizens in scientific research (Sauermann et al. 2020): According to the \u201cproductivity view\u201d, citizens can help to scale up and\/or improve the scientific output. Additionally, the \u201cdemocratization view\u201d considers non-scientific goals, e.g., democratization of science and making science more responsive to citizens\u2019 needs (e.g., Irwin 1995).\n### Input: What are the two specific approaches that explain the rationale of engaging with citizens in scientific research, according to Sauermann et al. 2020?\n### Response: The two specific approaches that explain the rationale of engaging with citizens in scientific research, according to Sauermann et al. 2020, are the \"productivity view\" and the \"democratization view\".

We assessed agreement between raters, and between raters and creators, using Fleiss\u2019 Kappa [ 38]. The three raters who rated all images agreed with each other with kappa of 0.253, (z =16.8, p<.001). Raw proportion of matching ratings between all pairs of raters ranged between 0.44 and 0.83. Roughly a third of the images (539) received unanimous ratings, a subsample of these can be seen in Fig 3. Including creator intention as another \u2018rater\u2019 gave a Fleiss kappa of 0.2 (z =18.9, p<.001). The raw proportion of ratings that matched creator intention ranged between 0.52 and 0.65 over the eight raters. For 367 of the images all raters and the creator agreed unanimously on the image classification. The average number of raters per image was 4.3. Even conservatively assuming only 3 raters, pure chance would have led to roughly 2*(1\/2)(3+1)*1516=189 unanimous images. Despite the somewhat low average rater agreement, this estimate as well as Fig 3 clearly demonstrate that there exist subsets of the created images for which the categorization (as a utopian or dystopian set) is clear.\n### Input: What was the level of agreement between raters and creators in recognizing images as utopian or dystopian based on Fleiss' Kappa?\n### Response: The level of agreement between raters and creators in recognizing images as utopian or dystopian based on Fleiss' Kappa was 0.2.\n\n"}

As Huynen et al. [64] argue, a small value for the fitness distance correlation (i.e., \u22120.15<\u03c1FDC<0.15) that would normally be connected with a very rugged landscape is not informative as to the ease or difficulty of finding the global optimum, since local optima, when connected, are no longer local [64]. Lobo et al. [59] conclude that there is an interplay between the ruggedness and neutrality of the landscape, and their simulations suggest that the desirability of neutrality is contingent on the former. For instance, for rugged landscapes, neutrality is beneficial, while neutrality just makes adaptation slower in smooth landscapes.\n### Input: What is the interplay between the ruggedness and neutrality of the landscape in social science problems, according to Lobo et al.?\n### Response: According to Lobo et al., the interplay between the ruggedness and neutrality of the landscape in social science problems is that the desirability of neutrality is contingent on the ruggedness of the landscape.

(2019) is that mutual learning exists among the AI and human components of the system. Such integration not only allows for, but necessitates the co-evolution of individual components (AI and human alike) with each other and the systems to which they contribute. Thus, we are entering into uncharted AI territory, where our best hope for advancing the field may require bootstrapping. In other words, the potential complexity of these systems suggests an opportunity to use HI itself to improve our understanding of HI. Asking why a given CitSci project is not solved entirely algorithmically can be a path to identifying new modes of human-machine problem solving by discovering suitable existing machine technologies and as well as to deeper appreciation of the distinctly human contribution in areas where current machine technology falls short.\n### Input: What potential opportunities could arise from using Human-Intelligence (HI) to improve our understanding of HI in the context of Citizen Science projects?\n### Response: The potential opportunities that could arise from using Human-Intelligence (HI) to improve our understanding of HI in the context of Citizen Science projects include identifying new modes of human-machine problem solving and discovering suitable existing machine technologies.

Size matters and so does accessibility From the analysis, a clear gap can be identified between the potential of scaling up assessment of creativity with the use of digital games, and the actual reach achieved in the examined studies. It is important to differentiate between two distinct purposes of scaling up. In research driven studies, scale up typically involves crowdsourcing and public participation through efforts to enhance engagement; the benefits of increased number of participants may include the possibility of posing and validating increasingly granular scientific models or group comparisons through the increased statistical power (Meehl, 1967 ). Thus, a given model granularity for e.g. an assessment tool sets a threshold requirement for participant numbers to achieve validity. After that is achieved the tool is ready for implementation scale-up that only aims to broaden the accessibility of the tool, not to provide further research validity. Such scale-up will typically be pursued through the established primarily educational networks such as inclusion in international or national educational testing initiatives.\n### Input: What are the two distinct purposes of scaling up in research driven studies and how do they contribute to the assessment of creativity with the use of digital games?\n### Response: The two distinct purposes of scaling up in research-driven studies are to enhance engagement through crowdsourcing and public participation, and to broaden the accessibility of the tool. The first purpose contributes to the assessment of creativity with the use of digital games by increasing the number of participants, which allows for the posing and validating of increasingly granular scientific models or group comparisons through increased statistical power. This sets a threshold requirement for participant numbers to achieve validity. The second purpose, broadening the accessibility of the tool, does not aim to provide further research validity but rather to make the tool more widely available, typically through established educational networks. This could potentially allow for the tool to be included in international or national educational testing initiatives.\n\n"}

Motivations such as the desire to learn, reciprocity, signalling, or the pursuit of an exciting idea influence sharing behaviour (Lakhani and Wolf 2003 ). Scientists appear to be willing to share (prepublication) results in exchange for feedback and credit and as a means to attract collaborators (Thursby et al. 2018 ). They also express a growing willingness to share data, particularly if formal citation is ensured (Tenopir et al. 2020 ). However, these motivations also differ among scientists from different fields, given that \u2018decisions about the openness of materials involve ongoing assessment of value\u2019 (Levin and Leonelli 2017 , 289). Indeed, one study suggests that 70% of field variation in disclosure is related to differences in respondents\u2019 beliefs about norms, competition, and commercialisation (Thursby et al. 2018 ; Haeussler et al. 2014 ). Particularly in fields with high mutual dependence, such as mathematics and physics, scientists disclose to attract new researchers to the field and to deter others from working on identical problems (Thursby et al. 2018 ).\n### Input: What role do scientists' motivations play in promoting openness and knowledge-sharing in different fields?\n### Response: Scientists' motivations play a significant role in promoting openness and knowledge-sharing across various fields. These motivations can include the desire to learn, reciprocity, signalling, or the pursuit of an exciting idea. Scientists are often willing to share their results before publication in exchange for feedback, credit, or to attract collaborators. They also show an increasing willingness to share data, especially if formal citation is ensured. However, these motivations can vary among scientists from different fields, as decisions about the openness of materials involve an ongoing assessment of value. In fields with high mutual dependence, such as mathematics and physics, scientists disclose to attract new researchers to the field and to deter others from working on identical problems.\n\n"}

For instance, scientists have reported that time, effort, and costs involved are obstacles to sharing data (Campbell et al. 2002). Another potential cost is the risk of misuse or \u201cresearch parasites\u201d (Fecher & Wagner 2016, Greene et al. 2017). Third, since data sharing and curation are expensive, more needs to be known about the potential uses and users of scientific data - specifically, how the cost of sharing data compares with the cost of reproducing it. Depending on the field and project, a difference in costs may incentivize different sharing strategies among scientists (Campbell et al. 2002, Tenopir et al. 2011).\n### Input: What are the potential costs and obstacles associated with data sharing in scientific research and how might these impact the strategies scientists use for sharing data?\n### Response: The potential costs and obstacles associated with data sharing in scientific research include the time, effort, and financial costs involved in the process. Scientists have reported these as significant barriers to sharing data. Another potential cost is the risk of misuse or exploitation of the shared data by \"research parasites\". These costs and obstacles could impact the strategies scientists use for sharing data by incentivizing different sharing strategies. For instance, if the cost of sharing data is higher than the cost of reproducing it, scientists might be more inclined to reproduce the data rather than share it. The potential uses and users of the scientific data also play a role in determining the cost-effectiveness of data sharing.\n\n"}

{"text":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: For example, the now-widespread availabil - ity of 3D printing technology has paved the way for open-source hardware to be used as  research equipment (Pearce 2012 ). The possibility of producing open-source hardware is  lowering the bar for conducting experiments that, in the past, would have required the  modification of commercially available equipment or expensive customised manufactur - ing. This proves particularly powerful in developing countries, where it can be difficult to  obtain and maintain the high-tech equipment used in modern laboratories. In addition,  3D printing increases the reproducibility of experiments, because identical research  equipment that has been validated by other scientists and openly licenced can be  produced at different sites (Murillo et al. 2019 ). These new fabrication technologies  have also accelerated the process of scientific and technological development  (Wajcman 2015 ). In the hands of the citizen science and maker movements, these  technologies are being incorporated into hackathons and makeathons that lower both  the cost and the time needed to innovate (Lifshitz-Assaf, Lebovitz, and Zalmanson 2020 ). \n### Input: How has the availability of 3D printing technology impacted scientific research and innovation, particularly in developing countries?\n### Response: The availability of 3D printing technology has significantly impacted scientific research and innovation, especially in developing countries. It has enabled the use of open-source hardware as research equipment, reducing the cost and complexity of conducting experiments that previously required modification of commercial equipment or expensive custom manufacturing. This is particularly beneficial in developing countries where acquiring and maintaining high-tech equipment can be challenging. 3D printing also enhances the reproducibility of experiments as identical research equipment, validated by other scientists and openly licensed, can be produced at different sites. Furthermore, these new fabrication technologies have accelerated scientific and technological development. They are being used in citizen science and maker movements, incorporated into hackathons and makeathons, reducing both the cost and time needed for innovation.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: The  Creativity Game Based Evaluation System (Yeh et al.,  2016 ) employs insight problems which can measure  elements of both CT and DT; however, the particular  study only collects data on the correctness of the  responses, not the process itself. With appropriate  adaptations, insight problems could potentially be  a promising direction for achieving non-verbal CT  assessment. However, the importance of capturing  the process in addition to the correctness of the  response should be underscored in future studies.\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and limitations of using the Creativity Game Based Evaluation System for assessing non-verbal CT, and how could future studies improve upon this method?\n### Response: The Creativity Game Based Evaluation System has the potential to measure elements of both convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) through the use of insight problems. This could be beneficial for assessing non-verbal CT as it provides a different approach to traditional verbal assessments. However, a limitation of this system, as it currently stands, is that it only collects data on the correctness of the responses, not the process itself. This means it may not fully capture the depth and complexity of an individual's thinking process. Future studies could improve upon this method by adapting it to also capture the process of problem-solving, not just the final answer. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's CT abilities.\n\n"}

Pasteur\u2019s quadrant in Stokes (1997)), the underlying rationale is that considerations of use trigger the identification of novel and relevant problems as well as potential solutions. The experiential knowledge of users may contribute unique inputs to guide future research efforts, especially when this knowledge is distant from the pool of knowledge of the scholars involved (Caron-Flinterman et al. 2005, van de Gevel et al. 2020, Guinan et al. 2013, Fleming & Sorenson 2014, Pols 2014). It is thus not surprising that in the hope of increasing the societal and scientific impact of research, policymakers, funding institutions, and advocacy groups are increasingly calling for the involvement of users of scientific research in early stages of scientific knowledge production (Beck et al. 2020, Mazzucato 2018).  \n### Input: What is the rationale behind the increasing call for the involvement of users in the early stages of scientific knowledge production by policymakers, funding institutions, and advocacy groups?\n### Response: The rationale behind the increasing call for the involvement of users in the early stages of scientific knowledge production is that the experiential knowledge of users can contribute unique inputs to guide future research efforts.
