### Input: What are the potential benefits of investing in AI solutions and why do human-centered AI systems rise to prominence despite the high failure rate of AI projects?
### Response: The potential benefits of investing in AI solutions include greater efficiency, faster and more accurate results, and more effective and improved strategic outcomes at the organizational level. Despite the high failure rate of AI projects, human-centered AI systems rise to prominence because they consider AI as a tool for human augmentation and pursue high levels of automation and user control simultaneously. This approach aims to overcome the brittleness of deep learning systems, which is often attributed to the failure of AI projects.

Although HCAI is derived from the human-computer interaction (HCI) field [2,3] with its solid emphasis on user centered and participatory design, it usually does not take into account the complex business workflows within a socio-technical system. 
### Input: Why do isolated AI solutions typically fail and how does the HCAI approach differ from traditional HCI methods in terms of addressing complex business workflows?
### Response: Isolated AI solutions typically fail because they only automate human workflows without managing organizational and behavioral change. This means they do not consider the broader context of the system they are implemented in, including the social and organizational structures that may affect their success. On the other hand, HCAI, derived from the HCI field, does not typically account for the complex business workflows within a socio-technical system. This suggests that while HCI methods may focus on user-centered and participatory design, they may not fully address the complexities of business workflows and the broader socio-technical system in which they operate.

### Input: What does the principle of human-centered interactions in Human-AI interaction development entail, and how does learning from failures contribute to continuous system improvement?
### Response: The principle of human-centered interactions in Human-AI interaction development entails designing the interaction based on Human-centered AI (HCAI) principles and the Human Interaction (HI) criterion of mutual human-AI learning. This means the AI system is developed in a way that it can learn from humans and vice versa, promoting a more effective interaction. 

Learning from failures contributes to continuous system improvement by capturing fine-grained and comprehensive process data of the entire human workflow. This allows the system to understand where and why it failed. Additionally, enabling user feedback in cases of AI failure provides valuable insights into the system's shortcomings from the user's perspective. This feedback can then be used to make necessary adjustments and improvements, thereby enhancing the system's performance and reliability over time.

Structuring scientiﬁc knowledge as an assemblage of interacting and evolving discipline- cultures, we conceive of a culturo-scientiﬁc storytelling to bring about positive transformations for the public in these thinking skills and ground our approach in quantum science and technologies (QST). This ﬁeld has the potential to generate signiﬁcant changes for the life of every citizen, and so a skills-oriented approach to its education, both formal and non-formal, is essential. Finally, we present examples of such storytelling in the case of QST, the classiﬁcation and evaluation of which correspond to future work in which this narrative approach is studied in action.
### Input: What is the role of outreach in developing the modern scientific mind and why is it considered essential in the society of rapid technological development?
### Response: The role of outreach in developing the modern scientific mind is to facilitate the understanding and appreciation of science as an evolving dialogue of ideas, with numerous alternative perspectives and uncertain futures to be managed. It is considered essential in the society of rapid technological development because it helps in structuring scientific knowledge as an assemblage of interacting and evolving discipline-cultures. This can bring about positive transformations for the public in thinking skills, particularly in fields like quantum science and technologies (QST) that have the potential to significantly impact the life of every citizen. Therefore, a skills-oriented approach to education, both formal and non-formal, is essential.

### Input: What are the key components of the inquiry cycle in scientific thinking and how do they contribute to the development of scientific knowledge?
### Response: The key components of the inquiry cycle in scientific thinking are observation, experimentation, and theory-building. These components contribute to the development of scientific knowledge by providing a systematic methodology for filling gaps in understanding. Observation allows for the identification of these gaps and the formulation of questions or hypotheses. Experimentation then tests these hypotheses, providing data and results that can either support or refute them. Theory-building, on the other hand, involves the interpretation of these results and the formulation of new theories or modifications to existing ones based on the findings. This process is cyclical and continuous, allowing for constant refinement and development of scientific knowledge. It also acknowledges that scientific knowledge is incomplete and ever-evolving, encouraging a constant search for new explanations, theories, or observations.

By fostering future thinking, this approach can positively impact students' ability to model the future and manage uncertainty. This has been demonstrated in the rapidly evolving contexts of climate change and Quantum Science and Technology (QST).

### Response: Including the process and core concepts in the narrative of Quantum Science and Technology (QST) is essential for a deep comprehension of the subject. It prevents the narrative from becoming a mere sequence of factoids and names, and avoids conveying the message that science is magic. It also provides an opportunity to challenge the understanding of the constituents of the periphery. This approach encourages scientific thinking at each stage of the process, prompting students to develop their own conceptualisations of the science resulting in the technology. 

The narrative of QST, particularly the core concepts, offers a unique opportunity to educate citizens of all ages to a new way of thinking that requires reliance on senses beyond everyday perception. This is particularly important at the borders of the classical-quantum crossover, where no direct perceptive experience of quantum phenomena is available. This holds true for both non-experts and experts in quantum physics and impacts their ability to interpret nature and model its uncertain futures. Therefore, intuition and imagination, which feed creativity, are invaluable.

### Input: What are the advantages of using outreach activities in teaching emerging fields such as Quantum Science and Technology (QST) over traditional means of instruction?
### Response: Outreach activities have the advantage of not being limited to any formal curriculum, unlike traditional means of instruction. This allows for a focus on deeply engaging activities, such as gamified and creative experiences, which can offer novel approaches to teaching. These methods can overcome some of the challenges educators face when teaching quantum concepts with traditional means of instruction. Furthermore, outreach activities can utilize existing tools to enhance the experience of participants, particularly within the time limitations available in such activities.

### Input: What implications might the expansion and increasing interdisciplinarity of Quantum Science and Technology (QST) have on education and research, and how might this influence the concept of interdisciplinary-culturo storytelling?
### Response: The expansion and increasing interdisciplinarity of Quantum Science and Technology (QST) might have profound implications on education and research. As QST technologies stem from different sciences such as physics, biology, medicine, computer science, and engineering, they will have impacts felt beyond traditional boundaries, in fields such as economics, judicial sciences, and philosophy. This suggests that education and research will need to reflect this increasing interdisciplinarity, possibly requiring a more integrated approach to teaching and studying these diverse fields. 

In terms of interdisciplinary-culturo storytelling, the increasing interdisciplinarity of QST might influence this concept by making it more reflective of the ever-tighter and more important interaction of the scientific Disciplinary Communities (DCs). As these DCs increasingly drive technological innovations, the stories told about these innovations and their impacts might need to incorporate perspectives from multiple disciplines, reflecting the complex, interconnected nature of the work being done in QST. This could lead to a more holistic, nuanced understanding of these technologies and their societal impacts.

### Input: What role does responsible research and innovation (RRI) play in promoting diversity, equality, and public engagement in Quantum Science and Technology (QST)?
### Response: Responsible research and innovation (RRI) plays a significant role in promoting diversity, equality, and public engagement in Quantum Science and Technology (QST) by emphasizing the importance of narrative. This narrative should highlight the contributions and leadership of under-represented minorities, such as women, in the development of quantum technologies. This can help to challenge societal biases and inspire the next generation of female and minority scientists. RRI also promotes openness, suggesting that specialist knowledge should be accessible to all, including the broader scientific community, citizens, and policy makers. Tools such as participatory and citizen science can be used to engage the public and interweave their experiences with the scientific community.

### Input: What is the role of the culturo-scientific narrative in engaging participants in scientific outreach and how does it contribute to the development of scientific thinking skills?
### Response: The culturo-scientific narrative in scientific outreach engages participants by taking them on a journey through the discipline-culture of a particular field. It draws them in with knowledge from the periphery of the field, which may challenge their existing understanding or models. This approach stimulates curiosity and allows participants to understand and access the working applications of the field. The narrative also exposes participants to the reality of being a scientist, emphasizing that there is always more to learn and no discipline-culture is ever complete. This engagement through the narrative allows outreach to act as a role-playing tool, where students become scientists themselves for the duration, exercising scientific thinking throughout. This contributes to the development of scientific thinking skills, or culturo-scientific thinking, which are essential in the current society, especially in the context of the ongoing second quantum revolution.

### Input: What is the purpose and process of co-developing research proposals in the context of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) practices?
### Response: The purpose of co-developing research proposals in the context of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) practices is to address the productivity crisis in scientific knowledge production, which is marked by increasing incrementalism. The process involves the co-production of scientific research, which refers to the joint effort of producers (academic scientists) and various ""users"" of scientific knowledge. These users can be active peer-users like practitioners or researchers using existing studies for further research, end-users such as patients, farmers, or companies who benefit from the research, and science hobbyists who engage with science for intellectual reasons or to shape public discourse. This approach is seen as a potentially powerful remedy to the productivity crisis in scientific research.

### Input: What is the rationale behind the increasing call for the involvement of users in the early stages of scientific knowledge production by policymakers, funding institutions, and advocacy groups?
### Response: The rationale behind the increasing call for the involvement of users in the early stages of scientific knowledge production is that the experiential knowledge of users can contribute unique inputs to guide future research efforts. This is especially true when this knowledge is distant from the pool of knowledge of the scholars involved. The hope is that this will increase the societal and scientific impact of research.

But the potential gains of the co-production approach come along with high costs and failure rates (e.g., Gulati et al. 2012, Shrum et al. 2001), requiring an improved understanding of processes for and contingencies in successfully co-producing scientific research. 
### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of the co-production approach in scientific research, as exemplified by the SPOMAN Open Science initiative at Aarhus University?
### Response: The potential benefits of the co-production approach in scientific research, as exemplified by the SPOMAN Open Science initiative at Aarhus University, include the ability to collaboratively translate real-world problems and the needs of industrial enterprises into fundamental research questions and related projects. This approach emphasizes the importance of engaging with the users of scientific research on equal footing to co-produce research, which can lead to more relevant and applicable research outcomes. 

However, the text also mentions that this approach comes with high costs and failure rates. This suggests that the co-production approach may require significant resources and may not always lead to successful outcomes. It also implies that there may be challenges in managing the collaborative process and in aligning the interests and objectives of different stakeholders. Therefore, an improved understanding of processes for and contingencies in successfully co-producing scientific research is needed.

### Input: How do individual attitudes towards collaboration and internal governance structures within research teams at CERN influence their patterns of knowledge sharing and collaboration with other teams?
### Response: The individual attitudes towards collaboration and internal governance structures within research teams at CERN can significantly influence their patterns of knowledge sharing and collaboration with other teams. Team members, such as senior and junior scientists, may have different perceptions of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration. These perceptions can be influenced by factors such as competitive considerations or labor market opportunities. These potentially conflicting attitudes can shape the team's sharing and collaboration patterns. Furthermore, the degree to which decisions are centralized or made openly by involving all team members, i.e., the internal governance structures, can also impact these patterns. For instance, teams with more open governance may be more likely to share knowledge and collaborate with other teams. The proposal suggests conducting surveys and interviews to empirically examine these mechanisms.

### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of open data sharing in science and how can policymakers develop successful data sharing policies?
### Response: The potential benefits of open data sharing in science include promoting transparency, fostering collaboration, and accelerating scientific discovery. However, it also presents challenges such as the complexity of selecting appropriate data, making the data interpretable and usable by others, and dealing with issues related to data format, documentation, infrastructure, ownership rights, and costs. These challenges may make scientists reluctant or unable to share their data or use the data of others. Policymakers can develop successful data sharing policies by addressing three key questions: why data sharing is required, when the benefits outweigh the costs of sharing, and how to measure the value of data sharing and the success of data sharing policies. A mixed-methods design can be used to identify and experimentally test potential policy levers to develop effective data sharing policies.

### Input: What are some potential strategies for effectively involving patients in co-creation activities within the medical research field, while also addressing their unique needs and expectations in an ethical and responsible manner?
### Response: The proposal suggests using participatory co-design methods and the lead user method to effectively involve patients in co-creation activities. This approach would allow patients to actively contribute to the development of innovative medical solutions. Additionally, conducting experimental studies with different groups, including patients, caregivers, and relatives, could help address the unique needs and expectations of each individual. This approach would also ensure that the research is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, taking into account the different vulnerabilities of each group.

### Input: What are the challenges and potential solutions in balancing immediate problem-solving and identifying underlying research gaps in the co-development process?
### Response: The challenges in balancing immediate problem-solving and identifying underlying research gaps in the co-development process include the tension between the desire to solve immediate problems, often by the users, and the need to identify relevant research gaps that could inspire new problem spaces. This tension can lead to an overemphasis on immediate problem-solving using familiar methods, at the expense of addressing the research gap. 

Potential solutions to these challenges include refocusing the conversation towards the research gap, questioning the underlying assumptions of the users' proposed solutions, and carefully listening to the users to identify and question their underlying assumptions or beliefs. It is also important to consider the differing incentives for the users and the researchers. Brainstorming in the team about what research has to say about these assumptions and where the open questions emerge can also help balance the different foci.

Text: Lastly, the societal implications encountered during this experiment would also merit further study. Despite inviting end-users who faced real-world problems within their particular fields to co-develop the proposals, there was no pre-defined connection to societal implications or benefits. Focusing specifically on societal problems, however, could make the co-development process a powerful tool to develop research proposals that better address societal challenges. In the future, this type of experimentation process could be carried out in creative multi-disciplinary spaces (e.g., CERN IdeaSquare, Living Labs, Design Factories). Such innovation spaces could lead to exciting use-inspired research proposals that pave the way for scientific breakthroughs and unexpected innovations. The fact that such creative spaces are also inhabited by students and young researchers could lead to interesting opportunities to further develop the resulting research proposals into actual projects.

### Input: What are some potential benefits of implementing the co-development process in PhD training programs and how could this be linked to Sustainable Development Goals?
### Response: The text suggests that implementing the co-development process in PhD training programs could lead to the development of research proposals that better address societal challenges. This could be achieved by engaging senior scholars as mentors with students working towards particular Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and potential users. This approach could extend pioneering projects that are already taking place, leading to innovative solutions for real-world problems. Furthermore, it could provide interesting opportunities for students and young researchers to develop the resulting research proposals into actual projects.

7,5,"In conclusion, even if co-developing scientific research proposals is not free of challenges, this experiment demonstrated that it is feasible to do so and to create direct value for both the producers and the users of scientific research. None of the groups involved in the experiment failed to produce a research proposal, and all participants followed through on their commitment to openly share the experiment’s outcome as a publication. Hence, with remedies at hand such as skilled facilitators, a concise and engaging process, and a committed team, co-development can lay the groundwork for setting research agendas that trigger use-inspired research projects that both address relevant questions and advance theory. By sharing the purpose, process, outcome, and reflections on this experimental approach to co-developing scientific research proposals, we hope to encourage future co-development endeavours for the sake of producing more novel and impactful research across different scientific disciplines. Likewise, we hope to encourage future researchers interested in the co-production of scientific knowledge to address the limitations of our experiment, for example by empirically assessing and comparing the quality of the resulting proposals with others developed through a conventional process. Last but not least, we hope to encourage scientists who did not take part in this experiment but are interested in the problems outlined in the proposals (see Appendix B) to reach out to the co-authors, get involved in a project, and thereby contribute to the co-production of scientific knowledge about open and collaborative research.",2023 - Experimenting with Open Innovation in Science (OIS,"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

10,2,"Research Question Development  What do we know about that OIS challenge from existing literature?  From existing literature, we know that involving users of research can be worthwhile and even necessary, for instance in order to access key insights needed in the research process and to increase the likelihood of uptake and diffusion of outcomes (Olmos-Peñuela et al. 2015, 2016).  A stream of research has focused on benefits and challenges of involving users in health and social care research (e.g. Wright et al. 2007, Barber et al. 2011, Domecq et al. 2014). Here users may be defined narrowly as patients or service users and their carers, or more broadly as possible patients, relevant community organizations and the like, health professionals, members of the general public, etc. (Wright et al. 2007). Benefits of user involvement include, e.g., increasing the range of research topics, focusing research on issues that are important to users, more effective dissemination of findings, an accelerated uptake of research, more effective and ‘user-friendly’ trials and interventions, and more use-informed interpretations of evidence (Trivedi & Wykes 2002, McLaughlin 2010, Barber et al. 2011). Effectively involving users in research processes is, however, no trivial task. Engaging users can raise a series of, e.g., legal, ethical, and practical issues which must be addressed by researchers (Beresford 2013). Others have pointed to the risk of user involvement in research taking on a tokenistic nature or being seen as a solution to all ailments (McLaughlin 2010). Moreover, involving users in research can challenge the autonomy of researchers and standard practices in the research process (Wright et al. 2007, Barber et al. 2011).

### Input: How can CERN encourage more knowledge sharing between different research groups and promote a more inclusive decision-making process that involves junior members such as postdocs?
### Response: CERN can encourage more knowledge sharing between different research groups and promote a more inclusive decision-making process by implementing the following strategies:

1. Establishing a Knowledge Sharing Platform: CERN can create an online platform where all research groups can share their findings, methodologies, and resources. This platform can be accessible to all members, including junior members, promoting transparency and collaboration.

2. Regular Inter-Group Meetings: CERN can organize regular meetings where different research groups present their work and discuss their strategies. This will not only foster knowledge sharing but also help identify potential areas of collaboration.

3. Inclusive Decision-Making Process: CERN can involve junior members in decision-making processes by creating committees that include representatives from all levels of the organization. These committees can be tasked with making decisions about research directions and collaborations.

4. Mentorship Programs: Senior members can mentor junior members, encouraging them to share their ideas and contribute to decision-making processes. This can also help junior members understand the value of collaboration and knowledge sharing.

5. Recognition and Rewards: CERN can introduce a system of recognition and rewards for those who actively participate in knowledge sharing and collaborative activities. This can motivate all members to contribute more actively.

6. Training and Workshops: CERN can conduct training sessions and workshops on the importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration. These sessions can also equip members with the necessary skills to effectively share knowledge and collaborate with others.

7. Open-Source Culture: Promoting an open-source culture where research findings are freely available can also encourage knowledge sharing. This can be achieved by publishing research in open-access journals and sharing data and resources openly. 

8. Encouraging Interdisciplinary Research: By promoting interdisciplinary research, CERN can encourage different research groups to work together, fostering knowledge sharing and collaboration. 

By implementing these strategies, CERN can foster a culture of knowledge sharing and inclusivity, leading to more efficient and innovative research.

### Input: What is the relationship between a team member's seniority and their perception of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration, and how does this influence their attitudes towards these practices?
### Response: The text suggests that a team member's seniority could be related to their perception of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration. However, the specific nature of this relationship is not detailed in the text. It is suggested that while senior team members might see personal benefits from sharing and collaboration, such as opportunities for permanent employment positions, they might also perceive greater costs and risks, such as a higher career risk if competing teams make discoveries first. This perception could shape their attitudes towards sharing and collaboration. However, further conceptual and empirical work is needed to fully understand these potential relationships.

### Input: What gaps in the existing literature on the organization of research teams, knowledge sharing, and science and engineering careers could be addressed to better understand the OIS challenge?
### Response: The existing literature could address several gaps to better understand the OIS challenge. Firstly, there is a lack of information on optimal decision making in scientific teams. Secondly, the literature on knowledge sharing could benefit from a discussion on potential disagreements within organizations about optimal sharing/collaboration, and whether such disagreements can be addressed through open governance mechanisms. Lastly, the literature on science and engineering careers could investigate whether career considerations may lead to conflicting attitudes towards openness and collaboration.

13,6,"How can the research question be answered (or the hypotheses tested)? RQ1 and RQ2 concern the team level of analysis. As such, quantitative analysis would require data on a large number of teams, using measures of governance, team diversity, and observed knowledge sharing and collaboration behaviors (see Fig. 1). At CERN, the number of research groups is limited, but each group is very large. This context may be more amenable for qualitative research into decision making processes within research groups and interactions between groups. This research could also gather rich qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members. It would be particularly interesting to compare governance and decision making processes across groups that seem to exhibit different levels of openness and collaboration.

### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.

Text: How can the research question be answered (or the hypotheses tested)? RQ1 and RQ2 concern the team level of analysis. As such, quantitative analysis would require data on a large number of teams, using measures of governance, team diversity, and observed knowledge sharing and collaboration behaviors (see Fig. 1). At CERN, the number of research groups is limited, but each group is very large. This context may be more amenable for qualitative research into decision making processes within research groups and interactions between groups. This research could also gather rich qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members. It would be particularly interesting to compare governance and decision making processes across groups that seem to exhibit different levels of openness and collaboration. Archival data on knowledge exchange (e.g., meeting records) and on collaborations (e.g., co-authored articles) would also be valuable. RQ3 concerns the individual level of analysis. If conceptual work based on existing theories does not lead to clear predictions regarding the relationships in Fig. 2, qualitative work (e.g., interviews and case studies) could be useful to build a stronger theory. If predictions are sufficiently strong, a survey of both junior and senior scientists could be used to test predictions.

### Input: What methods could be used to gather qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members in research groups at CERN?
### Response: The text suggests that qualitative research into decision making processes within research groups and interactions between groups could be used to gather qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members in research groups at CERN. This could potentially involve methods such as interviews and case studies.

### Response: The potential costs and obstacles associated with data sharing in scientific research include the time, effort, and financial costs involved in the process. Scientists have reported these as significant barriers to sharing data. Another potential cost is the risk of misuse or exploitation of the shared data by ""research parasites"". These costs and obstacles could impact the strategies scientists use for sharing data by incentivizing different sharing strategies. For instance, if the cost of sharing data is higher than the cost of reproducing it, scientists might be more inclined to reproduce the data rather than share it. The potential uses and users of the scientific data also play a role in determining the cost-effectiveness of data sharing.

For example, we can develop a matched sample of research projects or collaborations that share data and compare their success and productivity over time (see Christensen et al. 2019 and Zhang & Ma 2021 for similar approaches). Specifically, we aim to test a range of fields, outcomes, and levels of data sharing in order to gain insights into the process of determining what policies have been most successful. The third phase would be to partner with data sharing policy organizations to develop and run a set of randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiments. The first two phases will identify potential policy levers and measures of success that can be experimentally tested in the RCT. This last phase will allow us to more precisely develop successful data sharing policies for different fields and desired outcomes.
### Input: What is the purpose of the second phase in the empirical study on the impact of current data sharing policies and how will it contribute to the development of successful data sharing policies?
### Response: The purpose of the second phase in the empirical study on the impact of current data sharing policies is to understand the role of these policies in shaping new research, innovation, and other measures of success. This will be done by using matched samples or natural experiments to compare the success and productivity of research projects or collaborations that share data over time. The findings from this phase will provide insights into the process of determining which policies have been most successful across a range of fields, outcomes, and levels of data sharing. This will contribute to the development of successful data sharing policies by identifying potential policy levers and measures of success that can be experimentally tested in the third phase of the study, which involves running a set of randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiments.

### Response: The text mentions that multimodal research methods can include the use of different and often overlapping modalities of communication such as textual, auditory, linguistic, spatial, and visual. Some researchers have explored the use of arts-based methodologies in participatory research. These can include practices like photography, dance, and filmmaking. These methods contribute to the understanding of lived experiences in contexts where linguistic communication is difficult or impossible by providing alternative ways to express and communicate thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. For instance, a person might use dance to express emotions that they find difficult to put into words, or use photography to capture aspects of their lived experience that might be hard to describe verbally.

### Input: What insights can be gained from using participatory mapping as a research method to explore the experiences and perspectives of institutionalized individuals with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families?
### Response: Participatory mapping as a research method can provide insights into the spatial dynamics of access/exclusion and empowerment/deprivation that arise in the context of detainment. It can help to understand the perspectives of institutionalized individuals with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families, as well as other stakeholders such as human rights advocates and representatives of detention facilities. The method can shed light on the barriers encountered or expected by these individuals and the feelings or sense memories associated with them. It can also help to identify areas for service improvement or more robust oversight by comparing and contrasting the maps created by different stakeholders. Furthermore, it can facilitate engagement and communication among participants, allowing for shared or divergent understandings to surface.

### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of integrating different Open Innovation in Science (OIS) methods, such as lead user, crowd/citizen science, and patient co-creation, in the development and production process, and how can these be effectively managed to ensure ethical patient involvement and value creation?
### Response: The potential benefits of integrating different OIS methods include increasing the quality of innovation, reducing development risks, and speeding up availability and scaling. This is particularly relevant in areas where patient innovators are racing against time. For example, crowd funding by patients may lead to more rapid production and market availability. 

However, there are also challenges. The approaches have mostly been studied in isolation, and a study linking lead user, crowd/citizen science, and patient co-creation is largely missing. This suggests that the value generated by linking different practices along the development and production process is not yet fully understood or utilized. 

Moreover, co-creation with patients requires a careful and ethical approach. Capability development for patient involvement is required for all parties involved, and patient expectations and value creation should be well-managed. This means that OIS tools need to be carefully examined to ensure they reflect the complexity of and the need for patient engagement. 

To effectively manage these benefits and challenges, it is suggested that more empirical investigation is needed into the integration of different OIS methods. Furthermore, a careful and ethical approach to patient involvement is required, with a focus on capability development for all parties involved and careful management of patient expectations and value creation.

### Input: What are the different phases involved in a participatory co-design project with patients, relatives, and caregivers, and how do they contribute to the development, testing, and implementation of new products and services?
### Response: The participatory co-design project with patients, relatives, and caregivers involves several phases that contribute to the development, testing, and implementation of new products and services. 

Phase 0 involves understanding the needs of different stakeholders, developing ethical and inclusive guidelines for participation, and setting up a research project. This phase builds on prior literature and sets the foundation for the project.

Phase 1 involves starting with a number of rough solution concepts. These concepts are derived from various sources of ideation such as Lead Users, ideas from affected individuals, ideas from researchers/practitioners, and ideas from a group of students who do a guided brainstorming. This phase helps in generating a wide range of ideas for potential solutions.

Phase 2 involves identifying patients, caregivers, and relatives, selecting their most promising ideas, and entering a co-creation test stage for those ideas. Partnering with patients associations is also done in this phase to represent the interests of patients and their families in preparing for Phase 3. This phase helps in refining the ideas and preparing them for implementation.

Phase 3 involves recruiting patients, their relatives, and their caregivers for the main project stage. Co-creation with them is done through an online platform and/or through workshops. This phase helps in implementing the ideas and testing them in real-world scenarios.

Text: OIS Challenge: When it comes to clinical research and development of new medical devices, patients are usually very keen to contribute with their data, “first-hand” experiences, suggestions for improvements, and even with a clear definition of current limitations of available solutions. Researchers and industry usually do not provide compensation (beyond remuneration for participation) for this involvement, as patients already typically feel rewarded by contributing to the improvement in therapy. But with patients getting more involved in the development and improvement of devices, often providing important insights into product usability and design requirements and therefore leading to better products, questions have begun to arise as to whether and how their contribution should be rewarded.
### Input: Should patients be rewarded for their contribution to the development and improvement of medical devices, given their significant input into product usability and design requirements?
### Response: The text does not provide a definitive answer to whether patients should be rewarded for their contribution to the development and improvement of medical devices.

### Input: What are the potential ethical concerns and benefits associated with different approaches to data access and commercialization in the context of health research and development?
### Response: The text suggests that different approaches to data access and commercialization in the context of health research and development can raise ethical concerns about the usage and reuse of data. For instance, open access to data might undermine participants' trust in how their data is handled, potentially limiting their willingness to provide data or participate in studies. Similarly, a model of full commercialization of data might view patients and participants merely as sources of data, which could also affect their participation. However, the text also suggests that commercialization and privately driven research and development could ultimately lead to better medical devices and treatments, despite these ethical concerns. The text implies that a public approach or emphasis on public value might not resolve all these issues.

### Response: The text suggests that ethical concerns might arise if access to scarce medical technology or therapies is given based on participation in clinical trials rather than the medical needs of the patients because it could potentially prioritize those who have participated in trials over those who may have a greater medical need. This could lead to an unfair distribution of resources, potentially disadvantaging those who are in greater need but have not participated in clinical trials.

### Input: What are some of the challenges and risks associated with integrating AI in organizations, as discussed by Jacob Sherson, Director of the Center for Hybrid Intelligence at Aarhus University?
### Response: The challenges associated with integrating AI in organizations, as discussed by Jacob Sherson, include the fact that machine learning models, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance in labs, often fail in real-world settings. A study cited in his talk found that 70% of AI projects generate little impact when integrated into organizations. The risks associated with AI integration include the potential for AI to operate autonomously, with humans out of the loop. This could lead to bias amplification if there is bias in the training data.

2,5,"2.2 BLENDER Inblender , players blend multiple images together in order to get new, interesting compositions. How “much” each image should contribute to the resulting picture is up to the player: each image’s weight can be adjusted using a slider next to each image. blender uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ 14] which is the most widely used type of ML models for image generation [ 15,16]. Before studying if blender can be used as a creativity assessment tool, I first had to determine that players could express control over the interface and the algorithm [ 1]. Inblender , players first complete a tutorial which introduces them to the basic game mechanics and features. They then proceed through the three modes. In the DT mode players are presented with five images and are asked to create and save as many different ""animal-like"" creatures as possible in four minutes (Fig 2, left) and save at least three images. After completing the tasks, players are asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale how similar two images are. In the CT mode players are presented with a target image and three sets of three source images. Only one set can produce the exact target image, and players’ objective is first to determine which set was used to create the target image (up to 30 seconds) (Fig 2, right), and then to recreate their closest approximation of the target image (up to three min). There are three levels in this mode. The pilot study [ 1] revealed that it can be very frustrating for players if they have selected the incorrect set and are forced to spend three minutes attempting to create an unattainable solution.

### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.

Text: 2.2 BLENDER Inblender , players blend multiple images together in order to get new, interesting compositions. How “much” each image should contribute to the resulting picture is up to the player: each image’s weight can be adjusted using a slider next to each image. blender uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ 14] which is the most widely used type of ML models for image generation [ 15,16]. Before studying if blender can be used as a creativity assessment tool, I first had to determine that players could express control over the interface and the algorithm [ 1]. Inblender , players first complete a tutorial which introduces them to the basic game mechanics and features. They then proceed through the three modes. In the DT mode players are presented with five images and are asked to create and save as many different ""animal-like"" creatures as possible in four minutes (Fig 2, left) and save at least three images. After completing the tasks, players are asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale how similar two images are. In the CT mode players are presented with a target image and three sets of three source images. Only one set can produce the exact target image, and players’ objective is first to determine which set was used to create the target image (up to 30 seconds) (Fig 2, right), and then to recreate their closest approximation of the target image (up to three min). There are three levels in this mode. The pilot study [ 1] revealed that it can be very frustrating for players if they have selected the incorrect set and are forced to spend three minutes attempting to create an unattainable solution. Therefore, participants are allowed to end the question early by clicking “I think I choose the wrong set. ” Additionally, there is now a threshold for how close participants should get to the target image values for it to be considered a match to prevent participants from spending excess time fine tuning their images.

### Response: The importance of valid and reliable methods for assessing creativity, as emphasized by Guilford and the editors of the 2019 special issue of Philosophy, Esthetics, Creativity and the Arts, is that without proper instruments to measure creativity or adequate standards of assessment, the validity of any creativity study is seriously questioned. This means that the results of a study may not be trustworthy or accurate if the methods used to assess creativity are not valid and reliable.

### Input: What is the importance of valid and reliable assessment mechanisms for creativity and other 21st century skills in ensuring an equitable society?
### Response: The text suggests that valid and reliable assessment mechanisms for creativity and other 21st century skills are important in ensuring an equitable society because they are paramount for upward mobility and appropriate job placement. These assessments allow individuals, whether they are students, workers, employers, or governmental agencies, to understand their own skills or those of others. This understanding can then be used to ensure that individuals are placed in roles that suit their skills, promoting fairness and equality. Furthermore, the accessibility of these assessment mechanisms, such as through freely available online platforms, is crucial in ensuring that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, has the opportunity to assess and improve their skills. However, the text warns that it can be harmful to scale-up and provide easy access to invalid or unreliable assessment instruments, as they may provide inaccurate results and lead to inappropriate job placements or missed opportunities for skill development.

### Response: Divergent thinking (DT) and convergent thinking (CT) are two essential processes of creative thinking. DT is defined as the ability to come up with many different solutions to a prompt, while CT is the ability to find the single best (correct) solution to a defined question. In psychometric creativity assessment instruments, these concepts are typically measured in different ways. DT is often operationalized in terms of ideational fluency (the number of outputs: ideas, products, solutions), flexibility (how different the proposed outputs are from each other), originality (how unique an output is), and elaboration (the level of details in an output). CT, on the other hand, is typically measured by the ability to find the single best solution to a defined question.

### Input: What is the definition of 'creative process' as used in standardized tests for creativity, and what are some examples of these tests?
### Response: The 'creative process' in standardized tests for creativity is defined as the ability to come up with alternative or unusual uses of everyday objects, which is equivalent to Guilford’s definition of creative potential. Some examples of these tests include Guilford’s Alternate Uses Test, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, and the Wallach-Kogan Creativity Test. The Guilford’s Alternate Uses Test asks participants to think of different uses for common items like a brick or a pencil. The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking includes a variety of verbal and non-verbal tasks, such as Unusual Uses, Impossibilities, Consequences, Situations, Incomplete Figures, Creative Design, Circles and Squares. The Wallach-Kogan Creativity Test includes three verbal and two visual tasks.

### Input: What are some of the criticisms of standard creativity tests and how do they potentially impact the validity and reliability of these tests?
### Response: Standard creativity tests are criticized for several reasons. Firstly, they are often administered in strict testing conditions and artificial contexts, such as laboratories, which are far removed from natural situations where creativity is typically expressed. This can induce unintended physiological effects like test anxiety and the Hawthorne effect, potentially impacting the validity of the tests. Secondly, these tests are not particularly meaningful to the participants, which could affect their engagement and performance. Thirdly, they rely on simple interactions and only analyze the final product, which does not allow for capturing detailed steps in an individual’s creative process, potentially limiting the validity of the tests. Lastly, these tests rely on resource-intensive administration and human raters. The individual tastes, preferences, and idiosyncrasies of a small number of raters can impact the results. While employing multiple raters and measuring interrater reliability can be effective, it is resource-intensive and raters are susceptible to fatigue, which can compromise the reliability of their judgments.

Text: In the absence of valid, reliable, scalable, and accessible  solutions for assessing creativity, non-scientifically driven  corporate enterprises have leveraged new technologies,  creating widely used games and gamified platforms.  These games claim to foster and/or assess creativity and  other 21st century skills. Examples include: KnackApp (u.  d.), Kettlemind (u.d.), Figment (u.d.), BrainSparker (u.d.),  and Lumosity (u.d.). Some of these companies charge fees  based on promises to “find hidden talent and build your  strongest workforce” (KnackApp, u.d.), and encourage  people to purchase and play so they “do not get left  behind” (KnackApp, u.d.) . These games provide a user  friendly ‘creativity score’ which allows one to ‘certify’ their  creativity.

Despite  their caveats, these apps maintain substantial user bases in  the tens of thousands to millions (Strobach & Kupferberg,  2020 ). This information truly highlights the imminent  need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently  documented solutions.
### Input: What is the need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently documented solutions in assessing creativity, considering the popularity and questionable validity of current gamified platforms like KnackApp and Lumosity?
### Response: The need for accessible, scalable, scientific, and transparently documented solutions in assessing creativity is highlighted by the popularity and questionable validity of current gamified platforms like KnackApp and Lumosity. These platforms claim to foster and assess creativity, but often lack transparent methodologies or scientific documentation to support their claims. Despite this, they maintain substantial user bases, indicating a high demand for such services. Therefore, there is an imminent need for solutions that are not only accessible and scalable, but also scientifically valid and transparently documented to ensure the accurate assessment of creativity and other 21st century skills.

6,2,"Fortunately, efforts to systematically analyze and assess  elements of creativity and “processes that can evolve into  creative solutions” (Shute & Rahimi, 2021 ), embedded in  technology-rich environments (e.g., digital games) are  underway. Assessment in these environments is called  stealth assessment , where the player’s in-game actions  are continually logged, while the participant is immersed  in the activity, without being constantly attune to the  assessment. Stealth assessment is rooted in evidence cen- tered design (Mislevy, Almond, & Lukas, 2003 ), which  combines knowledge from both computational, and con- ceptual models.

### Input: What are the two main processes used in stealth assessment systems and how do they contribute to the assessment of a player's competency level in real-time?
### Response: The two main processes used in stealth assessment systems are evidence identification and evidence accumulation. Evidence identification involves identifying the predefined variables or observables from log files. Evidence accumulation, on the other hand, involves statistically linking the observables to the facets of the competency at hand. These processes allow for the assessment of the player’s competency level in real-time. As the players generate more data, the estimate for each player becomes more accurate. The fine-grained tracking and recording of player’s interactions can be used to analyze the player’s learning progress and provide ongoing feedback.

### Input: What are the main principles, pros, and cons of different creativity assessment instruments as discussed in the paper?
### Response: The paper discusses several creativity assessment instruments, each with its own principles, pros, and cons. 

1. Pen and paper standardized process-oriented assessments: These assess creative processes through individual or batteries of tests targeting components of divergent thinking (DT) or convergent thinking (CT). They have a large corpus of research, decades of practical use, and are often easy to manually administer. However, they are resource-intensive, potentially unmotivating, capture only final products, and may induce unintended psychological effects.

2. Digital standardized process-oriented assessments: These also assess creative processes through individual or batteries of tasks targeting components of DT or CT. They are scalable if automated assessment is possible. However, they are new and not widely studied yet, potentially unmotivating, resource-intensive when human raters are employed, and may induce unintended psychological effects.

3. Product-oriented assessment: This assesses the creativity of a product by individual and independent consensus of expert raters. It has a large corpus of research, decades of practical use, and clearly indicates ability to produce creative products. However, it is resource-intensive and therefore often not easily scalable.

4. Person and environmental focused assessment: This includes assessment of creative behavior, creative self-perception. It has a large corpus of research, decades of practical use. However, it has an increased risk of confounding variables given the broad scope, bias due to self-reporting, and is resource-intensive and therefore often not easily scalable.

5. Commercial game-based assessments: These can be forms of digitized psychometric and non-psychometric tests, or other unspecified mechanisms. They are designed to be used at scale and have engaging interaction design. However, they have little (if any) scientific backing or disclosure of methodology, and costs limit equitable access.

6. Digital game employing stealth assessment: Evidence needed to assess the creative process is provided by the players’ interactions with the game itself. It could offer opportunities for higher ecological and construct validity, is scalable when automated assessment is used, potentially more motivating than standard tests, and afford fine grain metrics. However, it is new and not widely studied yet.

The open code venue of publication was  added to highlight the diversity of publication outlets. See  table 2 for the final list of codes used in the analysis.
### Input: What are some of the fundamental questions one might ask while designing a digital game to assess creativity, and what additional components were added to the codes to address scalability and participant diversity?
### Response: The text does not provide specific examples of the fundamental questions one might ask while designing a digital game to assess creativity. However, it mentions that these questions inspired the next iteration of codes, which included the definition of creativity and the component of creativity measured (e.g., DT-flexibility, DT-fluency, DT-originality, CT). 

To address scalability and participant diversity, additional components were added to the codes. These included the number of participants, location, expertise, recruitment method, and compensation. The publication outlets were also recorded and sorted, and the open code venue of publication was added to highlight the diversity of publication outlets.

### Input: What methods do the games crea.blender and Droodle use to explore digitally augmented creativity and how do they measure divergent thinking (DT) and convergent thinking (CT)?
### Response: The games crea.blender and Droodle explore digitally augmented creativity by allowing players to interact directly with an algorithm during game-play. In crea.blender, participants interact with a neural network to create images. In Droodle, participants interact with a social robot by taking turns playing the game. Seven of the games, including these two, measure divergent thinking (DT) through some combination of fluency, flexibility, and originality. However, only crea.blender explicitly measures convergent thinking (CT), but it does not provide metrics for these measures. The Creativity Game-based Evaluation System uses insight problems that can be solved with different paths, which requires both CT and DT.

### Input: What are the motivations for using games for creativity assessment as described in various studies?
### Response: The motivations for using games for creativity assessment as described in various studies include scalable assessment, increased sample size, objective assessment, ecological validity of data, data richness, player motivation and engagement, and familiarity with games. Scalable assessment refers to the automated evaluation of creativity as opposed to manual assessment. Increased sample size means that the study can reach a wider population sample. Objective assessment refers to the elimination of certain levels of subjectivity in creativity assessment through automation. Ecological validity of data means that data collected from a game environment may reflect real-life behavior more authentically. Data richness refers to the ability of games to track progressing and provide more refined and richer data. Player motivation and engagement refers to the positive effect games can have on the players, such as reducing test anxiety and being more enjoyable than traditional tests. Familiarity with games refers to the convenience of games as a mode of data collection since they are common in everyday life.

### Input: What are the two distinct purposes of scaling up in research driven studies and how do they contribute to the assessment of creativity with the use of digital games?
### Response: The two distinct purposes of scaling up in research-driven studies are to enhance engagement through crowdsourcing and public participation, and to broaden the accessibility of the tool. The first purpose contributes to the assessment of creativity with the use of digital games by increasing the number of participants, which allows for the posing and validating of increasingly granular scientific models or group comparisons through increased statistical power. This sets a threshold requirement for participant numbers to achieve validity. The second purpose, broadening the accessibility of the tool, does not aim to provide further research validity but rather to make the tool more widely available, typically through established educational networks. This could potentially allow for the tool to be included in international or national educational testing initiatives.

### Response: The methodological challenges in pursuing research on gameplay data and its alignment with existing creativity research include: (1) the difficulty in accessing the necessary gameplay data as it may not be freely available or the appropriate data may not be recorded in the log files, (2) the need to identify games with suitable subtasks that align with existing creativity research or convincing game developers to insert these modes into the game, and (3) the challenge of structuring conditions in outside-of-the-lab studies to ensure many players experience roughly the same dynamics, which may conflict with commercial interests in maximizing player freedom of choice and enjoyment.

### Input: How does the complexity of a game relate to its ecological and construct validity in assessing creativity?
### Response: The complexity of a game relates to its ecological and construct validity in assessing creativity by providing clear goals, immediate feedback, and an appropriate balance between challenges and skills. This facilitates the 'flow state' which is important for creating an environment that affords the creativity of the players. Additionally, the complexity of a game, through progression through game levels, modes and rounds, provides sufficiently comprehensive and diverse data to accurately and reliably assess creativity.

### Input: What are some examples of games that have implemented progression in their design and how do they assess player creativity?
### Response: The text mentions two games that have implemented progression in their design. The first one is Physics Playground, which uses level-based progression. It assesses player creativity through stealth assessment in its standard play mode. Additionally, it has a level editor mode where players can create their own levels, which are then scored by expert raters. The second game is Crea.blender, which includes three modes with the same core game mechanics but different goals. Each mode is designed to assess either divergent thinking (DT), convergent thinking (CT), or creative products. Similar to Physics Playground, the 'creative products' mode is assessed by human raters. Within the CT mode, there are three levels, each increasing in difficulty.

### Input: What are the steps involved in the stealth assessment approach to understanding and assessing creativity in games, and how can this method be improved to better understand creativity?
### Response: The stealth assessment approach to understanding and assessing creativity in games involves three steps. First, it requires defining the claims concerning learners' competencies. Second, it involves establishing what represents valid evidence of a claim. Third, it determines the kind of tasks or situations that will elicit that evidence. This methodology also involves a thorough literature review of the competency that one wants to assess, such as creativity. The deep review of the literature serves as the basis for crafting a multifaceted, interconnected graphical representation of creativity. 

To improve this method and better understand creativity, the paper suggests not only using games to assess creativity but also to deepen the understanding of creativity. This could potentially be achieved by combining well-structured tasks that tap into convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) behavior and more free open-ended exploration such as in the final modes of creative blender and Physics Playground.

### Response: The text suggests that one of the main challenges in developing a robust, non-verbal assessment for Convergent Thinking (CT) in game-based creativity assessments is distinguishing between CT and Divergent Thinking (DT) based on task performance. This is because some game tasks may tap into both convergent and divergent processes.

### Input: What are the potential benefits and limitations of using the Creativity Game Based Evaluation System for assessing non-verbal CT, and how could future studies improve upon this method?
### Response: The Creativity Game Based Evaluation System has the potential to measure elements of both convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) through the use of insight problems. This could be beneficial for assessing non-verbal CT as it provides a different approach to traditional verbal assessments. However, a limitation of this system, as it currently stands, is that it only collects data on the correctness of the responses, not the process itself. This means it may not fully capture the depth and complexity of an individual's thinking process. Future studies could improve upon this method by adapting it to also capture the process of problem-solving, not just the final answer. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's CT abilities.

### Response: The even split between education/psychology and all natural science in the coauthorship of the selected papers suggests that the field of game-based creativity assessment has been investigated primarily within these specific scientific contexts. However, there has been limited interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, as evidenced by the low number of papers with representatives from both traditions. This could potentially limit the scope and applicability of the research in this field.

### Input: What is the importance of interdisciplinary dialogues between fundamental research on creativity, assessment considerations, and those designing new innovative assessment instruments in achieving large-scale, psychometrically stringent creativity assessment?
### Response: The text suggests that interdisciplinary dialogues between fundamental research on creativity, assessment considerations, and those designing new innovative assessment instruments are important in achieving large-scale, psychometrically stringent creativity assessment because they can facilitate greater cooperation and collaboration. This is necessary to address the challenge of creating robust and comprehensive assessments of creativity. Without such dialogues, there may be gaps in understanding and application, which could limit the effectiveness and accuracy of creativity assessments.

### Input: What are the three pillars of Open Science and how do they contribute to the knowledge production and dissemination process?
### Response: The three pillars of Open Science (OS) are accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity. Accessibility refers to open access to publications and research data, which allows for the wider dissemination of scientific outputs. Transparency, which includes reproducibility of results and open peer review, ensures that the scientific process is open and accountable, contributing to the credibility and reliability of the knowledge produced. Inclusivity, such as citizen science, opens up the knowledge production process itself, allowing for a broader range of contributors and perspectives in the scientific process. This not only democratizes science, but also potentially enriches the knowledge produced.

### Input: What is the current trend in the scientific research process regarding open and collaborative approaches, and how does it suggest an evolution and expansion of Open Science priorities?
### Response: The current trend in the scientific research process is increasingly discussing open and collaborative approaches at earlier stages. This suggests an evolution and expansion of Open Science (OS) priorities as it indicates a shift from the traditional closed processes of scientific discovery to more inclusive and participatory methods. This could potentially lead to a broader engagement in science, fostering innovation and accelerating scientific discovery.

### Response: The proposed concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) is a unifying foundation that integrates the complementary concepts of Open Science and Open Innovation. It is suggested to help examine specific exchange relationships and translation services between science and other sectors of society. OIS can advance our understanding of the process of generating and disseminating new scientific insights and translating them into innovation by providing a comprehensive picture of the various factors shaping open and collaborative practices in science. It can help us understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences related to applying open and collaborative research practices along the entire process.

### Input: What are some of the potential benefits and limitations of open and collaborative approaches in scientific research, as discussed in the text?
### Response: The potential benefits of open and collaborative approaches in scientific research, as discussed in the text, include improving the novelty, efficiency, and societal impact of scientific research. They can also lead to outcomes along the entire scientific research process, such as proposals, datasets, protocols, code, publications, patents, teaching materials, and science-based innovations. These outcomes can have scientific and societal impacts, such as an accelerated response to novel diseases. An example given is the role of open and collaborative practices in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, where knowledge-sharing allowed for rapid and coordinated progress. 

However, the text also notes that the effectiveness of these approaches depends on certain factors, and they may not be suitable for every scientific undertaking. For instance, do-it-yourself efforts to address shortages of medical devices and supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic were sometimes hindered by a lack of understanding of clinical needs.

### Input: What are the elements of the OIS Research Framework and how do they contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems?
### Response: The text mentions three elements of the OIS (Open Innovation Science) Research Framework: OIS practices, antecedents and boundary conditions, and OIS-based outcomes and impacts. 

1. OIS Practices: These are the methods and approaches used in open innovation science. They could contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems by providing a platform for open collaboration and knowledge sharing. This could lead to the discovery of new research areas or highlight the need for more research in certain areas.

2. Antecedents and Boundary Conditions: These refer to the factors that influence the implementation and success of OIS practices. Understanding these conditions can help in identifying areas where there is a lack of research or where certain societal problems are not being adequately addressed. This can then lead to these areas being prioritized for further research.

3. OIS-based Outcomes and Impacts: These are the results and effects of implementing OIS practices. By evaluating these outcomes and impacts, researchers can identify which areas of science and society are benefiting from OIS and which are not. This can help in identifying under-researched areas and prioritizing them for future research.

In summary, the elements of the OIS Research Framework contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems by providing a structure for open collaboration, understanding the factors that influence research, and evaluating the outcomes of research practices.

### Input: What are the challenges in establishing when interdisciplinary research takes place and how can a more fine-grained classification for levels of interaction address these challenges?
### Response: The text suggests that the challenges in establishing when interdisciplinary research takes place lie in the cognitive overlaps that make boundaries between and within disciplines difficult to identify. A more fine-grained classification for levels of interaction, ranging from weak to full, could address these challenges by providing a more nuanced understanding of the degree of interdisciplinarity. This could help to distinguish between different degrees of knowledge integration from source disciplines, from borrowing and contrasting to integrating and transcending existing bodies of knowledge.

Long-term collaborations also help to advance the development of instruments themselves (Tuertscher, Garud, and Kumaraswamy 2014 ), facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration between actors who might not otherwise collaborate (Kaplan, Milde, and Cowan 2017 ). Prominent examples of large-scale or ‘big science’ collaborations include the Manhattan Project, the Human Genome Project, and the Large Hadron Collider experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). Such a shared infrastructure can facilitate or even necessitate the application of OIS practices.

### Input: What are the two primary paths for data sharing in scientific research and how do they contribute to the principles of credibility and replication?
### Response: The two primary paths for data sharing in scientific research are voluntary data sharing via private communication and public repositories, and mandatory data disclosure in response to policies by journals and funders. These paths contribute to the principles of credibility and replication by providing access to underlying data and materials used in prior research. This allows researchers to build more quickly on prior work and enables data sharers to achieve more visibility and impact. Furthermore, data sharing serves as an essential backstop for these scientific principles, ensuring that the findings can be verified and replicated by other researchers.

### Input: What are some strategies to reduce the costs associated with preparing research data for reuse, and what are some potential benefits and concerns associated with these strategies?
### Response: The text suggests two strategies to reduce the costs associated with preparing research data for reuse. The first strategy is the real-time storing and sharing of certain kinds of data automatically, without the need for human intervention. The second strategy is the model of data science as a service, where scientists upload their data to cloud-based service providers that may also offer some level of processing and analysis. 

The potential benefits of these strategies include increased efficiency and reduced time and effort required to format, annotate, and curate the data. The use of cloud-based service providers could also provide additional services such as data processing and analysis. 

However, there are also concerns associated with these strategies. These include issues related to privacy, the risk of 'scooping' (where others use the data to publish results before the original researchers), and misuse of the data. Balancing these concerns against the potential efficiencies of data reuse is a key challenge.

### Input: What is the role of the public in the later stages of the scientific research process and how does this relate to the responsible research and innovation movement?
### Response: The public's role in the later stages of the scientific research process involves critically reflecting on the potential consequences of specific research findings and co-developing a suitable dissemination strategy to avoid misunderstandings and initiate informed debates. This role aligns with the responsible research and innovation movement, which emphasizes the involvement of citizens before research projects begin, through processes of priority setting and anticipatory governance. This approach requires all stakeholders to be mutually responsive and consider the societal implications of research and innovation activities.

Other studies have suggested a relationship between personality traits (e.g. the Big  Five) and certain aspects of or drivers for sharing behaviour such as creativity or  information seeking (Batey and Furnham 2006 ; Heinström 2003 ; Linek et al. 2017 ).  Moreover, personal characteristics such as gender and age may influence the application  of OIS practices.

### Input: What is the Matthew effect and how does it impact the distribution of credit and resources among scientists?
### Response: The Matthew effect, as described in the text, refers to the phenomenon where eminent scientists receive disproportionately greater credit for their work compared to lesser-known scientists who receive disproportionately lesser credit for similar contributions. This effect also extends to the distribution of resources such as funding, where eminent scientists are likely to attract disproportionately greater amounts. This could potentially provide them with better opportunities to engage in resource-intensive practices.

### Response: Scientists' motivations play a significant role in promoting openness and knowledge-sharing across various fields. These motivations can include the desire to learn, reciprocity, signalling, or the pursuit of an exciting idea. Scientists are often willing to share their results before publication in exchange for feedback, credit, or to attract collaborators. They also show an increasing willingness to share data, especially if formal citation is ensured. However, these motivations can vary among scientists from different fields, as decisions about the openness of materials involve an ongoing assessment of value.

### Input: What are the key advantages of teamwork in science and how does the composition of a team or group influence open and collaborative behavior?
### Response: The key advantages of teamwork in science include diversity, division of labour, and knowledge recombination. Diversity allows for a range of perspectives and ideas, division of labour enables tasks to be distributed according to individual strengths, and knowledge recombination allows for the integration of different types of knowledge to create new insights. The composition of a team or group can influence open and collaborative behavior. Research has shown that factors related to roles and role diversity within a team or group can impact how open and collaborative the team or group is. This could be due to the different skills, experiences, and perspectives that different team members bring, which can either enhance or hinder open and collaborative behavior.

### Response: Principal investigators (PI) within a research group play multiple roles. They act as project managers, negotiators, and resource acquirers, as well as researchers. These roles require them to develop a set of competences and experiences that allow them to function as boundary spanners between academia and industry. They are responsible for driving collaborations with industry, which requires them to be versatile and adaptable. Additionally, PIs are also responsible for the careers and well-being of the graduate students and postdocs within their groups.

While the presence of role models can positively affect academic scientists’ propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities (Huyghe and Knockaert 2015 ), such effects nevertheless remain variable, in part because individual scientists vary in the degree to which they are influenced by their peers.

For example, when deciding to collaborate with industry or engage in patenting activities, academic scientists tend to mimic the behaviour of departmental colleagues at a similar stage in their careers (Moog et al. 2015 ; Tartari, Perkmann, and Salter 2014 ) and the prevailing department culture instead of taking their lead from university patenting policies (Bercovitz and Feldman 2008 ; Kenney and Goe 2004 ). While the presence of role models can positively affect academic scientists’ propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities (Huyghe and Knockaert 2015 ), such effects nevertheless remain variable, in part because individual scientists vary in the degree to which they are influenced by their peers. For example, early-career researchers are more influenced by the collaboration behaviour of peers in their immediate social environment (Tartari, Perkmann, and Salter 2014 ). Likewise, the industry involvement of younger scientists has been shown to increase with the industry orientation of local peers (Aschhoff and Grimpe 2014 ). However, this relationship may not hold for all forms of OIS.
### Input: How does the behavior and attitudes of peers and local norms influence the engagement of individual actors with Open Innovation Systems (OIS)?
### Response: The behavior and attitudes of peers and local norms can significantly influence the engagement of individual actors with Open Innovation Systems (OIS). For instance, when deciding to collaborate with industry or engage in patenting activities, academic scientists often mimic the behavior of their departmental colleagues who are at a similar stage in their careers. They also tend to follow the prevailing department culture rather than adhering to university patenting policies. The presence of role models can positively affect their propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities. However, the degree of influence can vary among individual scientists. For example, early-career researchers are more influenced by the collaboration behavior of peers in their immediate social environment. Similarly, the industry involvement of younger scientists tends to increase with the industry orientation of local peers. However, this relationship may not apply to all forms of OIS.

### Input: What types of incentives may be required to motivate the implementation of open and collaborative approaches in research, and how might these incentives promote the reproducibility of results and faster dissemination of scientific findings?
### Response: The text suggests that collectively oriented incentives may be required to motivate the implementation of open and collaborative approaches in research. These incentives could include the design of specific rewards for ensuring the reproducibility of results. Such incentives could promote the reproducibility of results and faster dissemination of scientific findings by encouraging researchers to share their data and findings more openly. For instance, some studies have found that researchers are more likely to share their research data when a badge indicating whether results have been reproduced or replicated is published along with their article. This could potentially lead to faster dissemination and iteration of scientific findings. However, the evidence on the effectiveness of such incentives is mixed.

Scholars of science have paid  increasing attention to the role of specialised instruments in the production of scientific  knowledge, many of which were developed in and became strongly associated with  particular disciplinary communities (e.g. Lenoir and Lecuyer 1997 ). As interdisciplinary  problems and research teams come to the fore, though, previously domainspecific  technologies are being adopted by scientists across fields. This diffusion has facilitated  the distributed application of OIS practices. 
### Input: What role do specialized instruments play in the production of scientific knowledge and how has their adoption across various fields facilitated the application of Open Innovation Science practices?
### Response: Specialized instruments play a crucial role in the production of scientific knowledge as they are often developed within and become strongly associated with specific disciplinary communities. Their adoption across various fields, particularly as interdisciplinary problems and research teams become more prevalent, has facilitated the application of Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices. This is because the diffusion of these domain-specific technologies allows for a more distributed application of OIS practices, enabling collaboration and openness across different scientific fields.

### Input: How has the availability of 3D printing technology impacted scientific research and innovation, particularly in developing countries?
### Response: The availability of 3D printing technology has significantly impacted scientific research and innovation, especially in developing countries. It has enabled the use of open-source hardware as research equipment, reducing the cost and complexity of conducting experiments that previously required modification of commercial equipment or expensive custom manufacturing. This is particularly beneficial in developing countries where acquiring and maintaining high-tech equipment can be challenging. 3D printing also enhances the reproducibility of experiments as identical research equipment, validated by other scientists and openly licensed, can be produced at different sites. Furthermore, these new fabrication technologies have accelerated scientific and technological development. They are being used in citizen science and maker movements, incorporated into hackathons and makeathons, reducing both the cost and time needed for innovation.

### Input: What is the role of software developments in facilitating open and collaborative practices in science, and what are some examples of these platforms?
### Response: Software developments have played a significant role in facilitating open and collaborative practices in science. They have made it easier to break down the scientific and technological development process into component tasks and distribute them among multiple actors and entities. This has been made possible through dedicated platforms like InnoCentive. The free and open-source software movement has also inspired early calls for Open Science. The transparency of open-source code allows the scientific community to cross boundaries around field-specific software packages and converge on common solutions. Examples of these platforms include the software environment R and REANA, a research data analysis platform created by CERN. These platforms enable code and data reuse and reproduction, and have generated interest in disciplines well beyond their original fields.

### Input: What role does software curation and preservation play in maintaining the integrity of scientific research and how do tools like SciNote facilitate scientific argumentation and collaboration?
### Response: Software curation and preservation play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of scientific research by ensuring that the software supporting the research is properly managed and preserved. This is particularly important as certain types of scientific research become inseparable from the software that supports them. Without proper curation and preservation, the software could become obsolete or unusable, potentially compromising the research it supports.

Tools like SciNote facilitate scientific argumentation and collaboration by emulating elements of the scientific argumentation process. They allow users to collaboratively create, share, and evaluate each other’s ideas, fostering a collaborative environment for scientific research. This can enhance the quality of the research by allowing for a diversity of perspectives and ideas. Furthermore, these tools can also facilitate the dissemination of scientific research, making it more accessible to the public.

These outcomes, in turn, can feed into the  composition of diverse research teams and the co-development of research proposals  that, in both substance and format, differ from those initiated by scientists alone  (Williams et al. 2010 ). Even as elements of research design like the selection of methods  can be considered outcomes of collaboration, open lab notebooks and platforms like  protocols.io also facilitate the sharing of research instruments and tacit knowledge about  their use. Depending on the project, this might include technical artefacts like code or  fully functioning tools that others can adopt for their own purposes. Beyond the sharing  of data, open and collaborative practices at earlier stages of the research process can then  result in the iterative development of ‘thinking infrastructures’ (Bowker et al. 2019 ).
### Input: What are some potential outcomes of Open and Inclusive Science (OIS) practices in the early stages of a research project, and how might these outcomes influence the composition of research teams and the development of research proposals?
### Response: Open and Inclusive Science (OIS) practices in the early stages of a research project can result in various outcomes such as modified funding calls, evaluation guidelines, or even a decision not to pursue a certain line of inquiry. This can be influenced by the involvement of citizens and other stakeholders in setting priorities. An example of this is the bans on human cloning research, which were informed by public consultation. These outcomes can then influence the composition of research teams and the development of research proposals. Research proposals might differ in both substance and format from those initiated by scientists alone. The selection of methods can be considered outcomes of collaboration, and open lab notebooks and platforms like protocols.io can facilitate the sharing of research instruments and tacit knowledge about their use.

### Response: The text does not provide a specific definition of the replication crisis in scientific research. However, it suggests that it is a problem identified in some fields where the results of studies are not consistently reproducible, which can undermine the reliability of scientific knowledge. The application of Open Information Science (OIS) practices has contributed to addressing this issue by promoting the sharing of research data and protocols. This increased transparency allows for greater scrutiny of research methods and findings, which can help identify and correct issues that may be contributing to the replication crisis.

### Input: What are the potential negative impacts of developments in science, such as the creation of new markets in connection with Open Science, and how can suitable appropriation strategies address these issues?
### Response: The text suggests that one potential negative impact of developments in science, such as the creation of new markets in connection with Open Science, is the possibility of 'platform capitalists' capturing value from scientific knowledge without creating significant value for the science system. This could potentially lead to a skewed distribution of benefits, where the science system, which is the source of the knowledge, does not receive its fair share of the value generated. 

Suitable appropriation strategies could address these issues by ensuring that the value generated from scientific knowledge is equitably distributed. This could involve implementing policies or mechanisms that ensure a fair return to the science system when its knowledge is used for commercial gain. The text does not provide specific examples of what these strategies might be, but they could potentially involve things like licensing agreements, royalties, or other forms of revenue sharing.

Text: As mentioned above, however, assessing the societal impact of research and innovation is a tricky exercise marked by challenges that include causality, attribution, national borders, and time delays (Nightingale and Scott 2007; Bornmann 2013). The application of OIS practices may further exacerbate these challenges. For example, when reviewing research proposals in terms of societal impact, it is difficult to find reviewers with the capacity to evaluate at different stages and from different perspectives (Holbrook 2005). More generally, the (scientific) outputs of an expanded set of stakeholders can have a multitude of effects that can scarcely be captured by a single assessment mechanism (Molas-Gallart and Tang 2011).
### Input: What challenges might be faced when assessing the societal impact of research and innovation, and how might the application of OIS practices exacerbate these challenges?
### Response: Assessing the societal impact of research and innovation can be challenging due to issues such as establishing causality, attribution, national borders, and time delays. The application of OIS practices may further exacerbate these challenges. For instance, when reviewing research proposals in terms of societal impact, it can be difficult to find reviewers who are capable of evaluating at different stages and from different perspectives. Additionally, the scientific outputs of an expanded set of stakeholders can have a multitude of effects that are difficult to capture with a single assessment mechanism.

### Input: What are the three significant contributions of the OIS Research Framework and this article in understanding open and collaborative practices in science?
### Response: The text mentions three significant contributions of the OIS Research Framework and this article in understanding open and collaborative practices in science. First, they bridge disciplinary differences in terms of norms, theories, assumptions, methods, and languages through an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach. Second, they provide a more complete understanding of the available knowledge needed to manage processes of openness and collaboration in science, adding to the science of science literature.

### Input: What are some of the potential benefits of integrating different disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in future research activities, as suggested by the framework in this article?
### Response: The framework in this article suggests several potential benefits of integrating different disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in future research activities. Firstly, it can help to surface tensions and incongruities between disciplines, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Secondly, it can help to determine under which conditions one perspective has more explanatory power than another. Thirdly, it can help to align and integrate different perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding. Fourthly, it can enrich the research by combining the strengths of different methodologies. For example, quantitative fields could benefit from a richer qualitative understanding, while qualitative traditions could be enriched by the larger-scale insights and opportunities for causal identification that quantitative approaches can provide. Lastly, involving practitioners from different fields can bring unique experiential knowledge into discussions.

### Response: Understanding the time scales and rhythms of interaction between stakeholders for different Open Innovation System (OIS) practices is important due to the long-term nature of many scientific projects. This understanding can help manage the more intense and longer-term engagement required in these projects compared to shorter innovation processes. It can also help navigate potential conflicts between different OIS practices and stakeholders, such as the differing goals of firms and scientists regarding data openness and patenting.

The development of a multi-dimensional measurement scale of OIS practices can be beneficial in capturing the intensity of effort when applying certain practices alone or in combination. This tool would provide a more nuanced understanding of OIS practices, allowing for more effective management and coordination. It would also enable future studies to better analyze and compare the effectiveness of different OIS practices, potentially leading to more successful innovation outcomes.

### Input: What could serve as key performance indicators for the scientific and societal impacts of Open Innovation Science (OIS), and how can the positive and negative consequences of applying OIS practices be tracked and elaborated for individual scientists, research teams or groups, and research organisations?
### Response: The text does not provide specific examples of what could serve as key performance indicators for the scientific and societal impacts of Open Innovation Science (OIS). Similarly, it does not detail how the positive and negative consequences of applying OIS practices can be tracked and elaborated for individual scientists, research teams or groups, and research organisations. However, it suggests that these are important areas for future research and that the framework presented in the article provides many touchpoints for this research. It also implies that work on research metrics and indicators could be useful in this context.

### Input: What is the concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) and how can it advance our understanding of the processes involved in generating and disseminating new scientific insights?
### Response: The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) is proposed as a unifying foundation that can advance our understanding of the processes involved in generating and disseminating new scientific insights. It focuses on the application of open and collaborative practices throughout the entire process of creating and sharing new scientific knowledge and translating them into innovation. This concept can help us understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences related to these practices. By synthesizing insights from various disciplines about openness and collaboration, OIS can help design and manage efficient and effective processes for producing and disseminating scientific knowledge. It also aims to stimulate discussions and scientific efforts to address identified gaps, with the ultimate goal of producing more novel and impactful scientific knowledge to meet the challenges of our time.

### Response: The main challenge faced in the process of synthesising a broad range of different arguments for the OIS Research Framework was to do so without compromising on the content. This required several additional steps that were not initially planned. To overcome this, the co-authors were asked to first collect the literature for the different boxes and arrows of the OIS Research Framework in nine tables, resulting in more than 200 entries. This allowed the team to identify similarities and differences before initiating the writing process, and also helped to surface some enriching discussions as they structured an outline of the article.

### Input: What is the process of collaborative conceptualisation at the first OIS Research Conference in 2019?
### Response: The process of collaborative conceptualisation at the first OIS Research Conference in 2019 involves several steps. First, a simple process model defining OIS is presented. This is followed by individual reflection on missing or misplaced elements in the initial model. Participants are then randomly assigned into groups to refine the initial model. These groups then present their modified frameworks. A joint discussion of the resulting modifications is held until a preliminary consensus is reached. Finally, a main coordinator is appointed to organise and structure the collaborative process. This entire stage lasts for two days.

### Input: What is the role of the Organising Team (OT) in the process of developing and finalising an academic article according to Table A?
### Response: The Organising Team (OT) plays a significant role in the process of developing and finalising an academic article according to Table A. They are responsible for pre-structuring the article's subsections to avoid redundancies in the text later. They also edit the bullet points into text, aligning content, language, writing styles, formats, etc. of the main body and coordinate with co-authors to resolve disagreements. The OT also synthesises, streamlines, and complements content to meet the journal’s page limit, preserving the arguments made by all co-authors and shortening the text by synthesising and restructuring the content. They also synthesise input into a first draft of the discussion. In the final stages, the OT reviews and edits the entire document, prepares it for final proofs, and enters final changes before finalising and submitting the manuscript.

### Input: How are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) used as creative tools by both professional and non-professional users in the context of artistic expression?
### Response: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used as creative tools in the context of artistic expression by both professional and non-professional users in several ways. Professional artists use GANs as a new medium for their art, as a source of inspiration for new ideas, and as a tool to assist with laborious tasks. On the other hand, GANs also enable non-professional users or those with physical impediments to express themselves creatively by lowering the threshold for technical skills or capabilities.

### Input: What is the function of Artbreeder and how does it contribute to the field of image generation?
### Response: Artbreeder is a massive online tool for creating images based on interactive latent variable evolution. It allows images to be 'bred' by selecting the generated offspring of parent images and also allows for direct 'gene' editing. It functions as a hybrid of a tool and a social network, enabling users to share what they create and edit what they see. This community-driven innovation allows certain images to go viral, spreading their 'DNA' throughout the image repository. Therefore, Artbreeder contributes to the field of image generation by providing a platform for collaborative image creation and evolution, fostering creativity and the spread of new image 'genes'.

This is done using the generator of a pre-trained StyleGAN2 [ 36], trained to produce images based on style and content. After completing a tutorial, users blend images by changing the slider values for the style and content of each of the images (Fig 1, left), taking content (large scale features) from some images, and blending them with the style (small scale features and texture) of other images. Users are presented with 4 source images that can be freely ‘swapped’ with alternative images. When users save an image, they label it as being either utopian, or dystopian. The image and the label are then stored in a database. There is also a publicly available galleryof all generated images (Fig 1, right). Users can download their own saved images and any images in the public gallery. In crea.blender SDG there are 102 source images, selected from the landscape category in Artbreeder.

### Response: The factors considered in the image generation game to empower the general public to envision the future were the style of the image (described as ""stylistic aspects such as blurry or sharp and well-defined shapes"") and a motif in the image (described as ""a specific identifiable element such as trees, a river, or a building""). These factors were chosen because the two sliders used when generating the images were assigned to content and style (covering colors) respectively.

### Input: What does the analysis reveal about the flexibility of crea.blender SDG in producing both utopian and dystopian images?
### Response: The analysis reveals that crea.blender SDG offers significant flexibility in producing both utopian and dystopian images. The total number of distinct images that could be produced by the full input space of the GAN is about 4*1014, indicating a vast range of possible output images. The diversity of the source images chosen and the range of slider values used also suggest that saved images came from diverse regions of the space. However, there was a tendency for some source images to be more popular than others, and there was a correlation between style and content slider values. Despite this, no specific association was found between source image and slider value. The presence of clusters of similar images was also noted, suggesting that users might have been attracted to particular images.

### Input: What are the potential limitations of the current study on human-GAN interactions and what areas could be explored in future research?
### Response: The potential limitations of the current study on human-GAN interactions include a small number of raters and a consequent small number of ratings per image, which limit conclusions about the status of individual images or systematic rater heterogeneity. The raters were also WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), and thus likely to share cultural references, color and motif preferences, etc. Future research could explore work with a larger and more diverse number of raters to address these limitations.

### Input: What are the benefits of using gamification in education and how can it be effectively implemented to enhance student learning experiences?
### Response: The text suggests that using gamification in education can provide students with the opportunity to solve problems in a game-like environment, which allows for a wide range of trial and error. This can help students understand the relationships between interacting elements, which can be difficult to express in traditional lecture and lab-based formats. To effectively implement gamification and enhance student learning experiences, the text suggests that the interactions within the game need to be presented with purpose. Additionally, students should be allowed to reflect on their experiences within the game in conjunction with their overall learning trajectories.

2,3,"CONTENT AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES IN Student Researcher Our a priori goal was to create an active and fluid environment, wherein learners could engage with the curriculum on multiple cognitive dimensions. We implemented a points-badges-leaderboard framework, which awarded points to the users for completing tasks, and a weekly badge for exceeding a threshold number of points.

Text: CONTENT AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES IN Student Researcher Our a priori goal was to create an active and fluid environment, wherein learners could engage with the curriculum on multiple cognitive dimensions. We implemented a points-badges-leaderboard framework, which awarded points to the users for completing tasks, and a weekly badge for exceeding a threshold number of points. The students were aware that neither the points nor the badges would have direct influence on their grades, but just as the conventional theoretical exercises, Student Researcher was framed as part of the course material in preparation for the oral exam. A leaderboard displaying high scores of the interactive elements was placed at the landing page [Fig.1]. 
### Input: What was the purpose of implementing a points-badges-leaderboard framework in the Student Researcher program and how did it influence student engagement with the curriculum?
### Response: The purpose of implementing a points-badges-leaderboard framework in the Student Researcher program was to create an active and fluid learning environment. This framework awarded points to users for completing tasks and a weekly badge for exceeding a certain number of points. This was designed to engage learners with the curriculum on multiple cognitive dimensions. Although the points and badges did not directly influence the students' grades, they were framed as part of the course material in preparation for the oral exam, thereby encouraging students to engage more with the curriculum. The leaderboard displaying high scores further added an element of competition, potentially motivating students to participate more actively.

### Input: What measures were taken to ensure student comfort and autonomy in the Student Researcher program?
### Response: Several measures were taken to ensure student comfort and autonomy in the Student Researcher program. Firstly, students could opt-out of appearing on the leaderboards seen by classmates to avoid any feelings of negative exposure. Secondly, the content was divided into weeks in accordance with scheduled lectures, with each week consisting of multiple voluntary lessons. Each lesson required 10–20 minutes to complete, allowing students to move through the material at their own pace. At the end of each week, students were asked to reflect on the curriculum by filling in text fields describing the hardest and the most important parts of the curriculum that week. This not only allowed for reflection but also conveyed a sense of co-creation. Lastly, a badge was awarded when a student exceeded a set number of points during a week, providing a sense of achievement.

### Input: What is the Stern-Gerlach experiment and how does its 3D simulation in the Unity development environment help students understand the statistical nature of quantum physics?
### Response: The Stern-Gerlach experiment (SGE) is a fundamental experiment in quantum physics that illustrates the counterintuitive quantum effects that appear when a spin is measured along orthogonal axes. The 3D simulation of the SGE in the Unity development environment helps students understand the statistical nature of quantum physics by allowing them to interact with a spatial setting. The simulation displays a stream of particles in a 50-50 mixture of the spin-up and spin-down states going through up to three sets of rotatable magnets. Each set of magnets alters the path of each particle based on the spin. If a screen is placed after a set of magnets, the spin of the particles can be determined. This interactive simulation enables students to apply the theory in a practical way and highlights the statistical nature of quantum physics.

### Input: What is one advantage of StudentResearcher and how did it help in understanding the transformation of two-level superposition states from one basis to another?
### Response: One advantage of StudentResearcher is the instantaneous feedback it provides upon answering. This feature helps students identify their own cognitive disconnects between topics that may seem simple on the surface but contain hidden complexities when explicit calculations are required. In the context of understanding the transformation of two-level superposition states from one basis to another, StudentResearcher helped reveal a widespread conceptual disconnect when transitioning from abstract knowledge to concrete calculations. This insight then allowed the lecturer to address this disconnect in subsequent lectures, leading to a deeper coverage of the subject.

### Input: Why might students prefer multiple-choice tests over simulations, despite evidence of learning improvement from the latter?
### Response: Students might prefer multiple-choice tests over simulations because these tests more closely match the explicit format used in traditional teaching practices and oral exam procedures. They may feel that they fail to gain understanding from the simulations. Any implicit knowledge obtained from the simulations may be opaque to them, likely due to the influence of traditional, semantically explicit and highly exam-focused teaching traditions.

### Input: What are the key assumptions of the NK framework in computational modeling research on human problem-solving, and what limitations does the most common approach to conceptualizing the complexity of a landscape have?
### Response: The key assumptions of the NK framework in computational modeling research on human problem-solving are that the NK captures the continuum of the complexity of empirical fitness landscapes and that search behavior is a distinct component, independent from the topology of the fitness landscape. The limitations of the most common approach to conceptualizing the complexity of a landscape are that it does not adequately capture the nature of the fitness landscape and how it is fundamentally intertwined with search behavior.

### Input: What is the NK model and how does it relate to the study of adaptive evolution?
### Response: The NK model is an extension of Wright's fitness landscape model, which is used to study population genetics. The NK model explicitly models adaptive evolution as a ""search in protein space"", which attempts to find a maximum point for a chosen fitness function. This means it is used to represent the process of evolution as a search for the most optimal genetic configuration, or the ""fittest"" state. This approach has been used to computationally model complex, adaptive systems in various fields.

### Input: What is the impact of interdependence between modules on the problem-solving approach in designing a new educational app?
### Response: The interdependence between modules in designing a new educational app can significantly impact the problem-solving approach. If the modules are highly interconnected, changing something in one module might influence the functionality of another module. In such cases, changing one small element at a time, also known as ""local-search"", might not be efficient due to the high level of interdependency. The extent of this interdependence varies from environment to environment and influences how one should search for a good design.

### Input: What is the NK model and how is the fitness value calculated in this model?
### Response: The NK model is a method used to simulate how individual or organizational agents adapt over time in a competitive environment. In this model, all positions x in the fitness landscape belong to an N-dimensional space where the value along each dimension can take the value of 0 or 1, representing whether attributes of genes are active or not. The neighborhood size parameter K determines the level of inter-dependency among the dimensions when evaluating the fitness value f(x). 

The fitness value for x is computed by calculating the value of the N·2 K+1 given local fitness functions. These local fitness functions are represented as f i(x) = fixi;xi1,. . ., xiK, where x i1,. . ., xiK are the values of the K successive neighbors to the ith dimension. The neighbors are taken in a cyclic manner. The fitness value of x is then the average of the local fitness functions: f(x) = 1N Ni=1 fi(x). 

For example, if N=3 and K=1, the fitness value of x=110 would be calculated as f(110) = 1/3f 1(11) +f2(10) +f3(01) = 1/3(0.75+0.42+0.95) =0.71.

Furthermore, the model also assumes that the searcher primarily engages in local-search akin to the one-bit-flip mutations of a gene. We want to address these assumptions in a social context and offer a technical, comparative analysis of search and the empirical landscapes we intend to model.
### Input: What are the primary assumptions of the original NK model and how do they compare to other simulation frameworks such as armed bandits?
### Response: The primary assumptions of the original NK model are that one can modify the complexity by varying the interdependence of elements and that the searcher primarily engages in local-search akin to the one-bit-flip mutations of a gene. Compared to other simulation frameworks such as armed bandits, the NK model is more flexible due to its ability to vary the interdependence of elements. This feature is not as prevalent or flexible in other models like the armed bandits.

### Input: How does changing the parameters of search behavior impact the assessment of the difficulty of a fitness landscape in social science studies?
### Response: The text suggests that changing the parameters of search behavior can impact the assessment of the difficulty of a fitness landscape in social science studies by altering the perceived complexity or ruggedness of the landscape. This is because the conceptualization of the fitness landscape is not independent of assumptions about search behavior. Therefore, if the parameters of search behavior are changed, the assessment of the landscape's difficulty should be able to account for these changes.

### Input: What is the proposed future direction for research regarding the classification of the ruggedness of a fitness landscape?
### Response: The proposed future direction for research regarding the classification of the ruggedness of a fitness landscape is to move beyond a simple numerical classification and instead rely on an overall categorization of the type of fitness landscape at hand. This could help determine which search algorithms to apply in a given situation. There is also a need for further comparisons of the NK fitness landscape features with characteristics found in the empirical world, in terms of both task structure and search behavior.

### Input: What is the default search strategy in social science studies that rely on the NK model, and why are other search strategies often integrated?
### Response: The default search strategy in social science studies that rely on the NK model is generally local-search, specifically a one-bit-flip hill-climber. This strategy reflects the nature of genetic mutations. However, other search strategies are often integrated because in a landscape consisting of many local peaks, a local-search strategy is likely to lead the agent to become stuck before reaching the global peak. Therefore, strategies such as random jumps or directed search based on a cognitive representation of the landscape are used to avoid this issue.

### Input: What does the WZ_heK/Nratio in the NK model represent in terms of problem difficulty and epistatic interactions?
### Response: The WZ_heK/N ratio in the NK model represents the level of problem difficulty and the level of epistatic interactions. The higher the ratio, the more interconnected the bits are, indicating a more complex problem with more dependencies to consider when evaluating the fitness value. This ratio also represents the level of epistatic interactions, which is equivalent to the nonlinearity of a problem or how well a problem can be decomposed into subproblems.

### Input: What does the higher K/N ratio indicate in the NK field studies and how does it affect the agent's ability to search in the landscape?
### Response: The higher K/N ratio in the NK field studies indicates a more rugged landscape. This increased ruggedness makes it more difficult for the agent to search in the landscape. This is because the landscape's complexity and the number of local peaks increase with the K/N ratio, making it harder to find the global optimum.

Rahmandad has also proposed a variant of a fitness model (PN) where interdependence is modeled as an interaction polynomial, allowing both the sign and magnitude of the epistatic effect to be modeled.

### Input: What are the two main limitations of using epistasis measures as proxies for problem complexity?
### Response: The two main limitations of using epistasis measures as proxies for problem complexity are: 

1. Epistatic interactions can be both positive and negative. The distinction between whether an interaction effect between two alleles is positive or negative has a significant impact on the difficulty of a problem, but epistasis measures (like epistasis variance or correlation) cannot capture this distinction.

2. Empirical evidence suggests that epistatic interactions can occur at several levels, meaning there are hierarchical interdependence structures. This has consequences for the long-term dynamics of the system, which may not be adequately represented by epistasis measures.

### Response: The hierarchy in the structure of higher-order epistatic interactions in biology is conceptualized as the composition of systems out of subsystems, with each subsystem having its own hierarchy until a certain level of fine-grained modularity is achieved. This hierarchical structure is similar to that found in organizational problems, particularly innovation problems. This type of problem complexity, which is qualitatively different from landscape ""ruggedness"", is most likely to be encountered in real-life problems.

This challenges the ""rugged landscape"" metaphor in evolutionary dynamics, which focuses on the distinction between smooth and rugged landscapes and how to measure ruggedness. The neutral theory suggests that some solutions may have equal fitness, questioning the idea of a rugged landscape where different solutions would have different fitness levels.

### Input: What is the modality of a landscape in computer science and how does it affect the complexity of a problem?
### Response: In computer science, the modality of a landscape refers to the number of local maxima. It is often computed relative to the size of the fitness landscape. The complexity of a problem is affected by the modality in that the higher the density of local optima, the more complex the problem becomes. This is because a higher density of local optima increases the likelihood that a solver will get stuck and be unable to find the optimal solution.

### Input: What does the fitness-distance correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution in different classes of landscapes?
### Response: The fitness-distance correlation coefficient indicates the relationship between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution in different classes of landscapes. In straightforward landscapes (ρ FDC ≤−0.15), there is a strong correlation where the closer a solver gets to the global optimum, the higher the fitness is. These are typically ""smooth"" landscapes. In difficult landscapes (−0.15<ρ FDC<0.15), there is limited correlation between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution, making these optimization problems hard to solve.

### Input: What is the significance of the fitness distance correlation in understanding the difficulty of navigating a landscape, according to Jones and Forrest's research?
### Response: According to Jones and Forrest's research, the fitness distance correlation is significant in understanding the difficulty of navigating a landscape as it provides a quantitatively informed qualitative assessment of the landscape's difficulty. It captures the challenge of deceptiveness in the landscape, which is something the K/N ratio fails to do. However, it requires a priori knowledge of the global optimum. It also helps in classifying the type of fitness landscape, which aligns with the recent trend of classifying landscapes to identify the appropriate algorithm.

Typically, an agent is set to primarily engage in one-bit flips when searching the landscape, although other kinds of distant search strategies such as random search or searches that match the underlying landscape have also been implemented [15, 26, 29].

### Response: The extent of ruggedness in Kauffman's original model represents the complexity or difficulty of a landscape, which is determined by a one-bit-flip mutation of the candidate solution. This is related to the difficulty of a landscape for an agent's search strategy because it suggests that the difficulty of a landscape is not inherent, but rather depends on the agent's prevalent search strategy.

### Input: What are the limitations of the one-bit-flip assumption in the context of human search behaviors according to Frenken et al.?
### Response: According to Frenken et al., the one-bit-flip assumption is of limited relevance in the context of human search behaviors because it does not fit human behavior. This is because human problem-solvers are not constrained to engaging in small, incremental changes, as suggested by the one-bit-flip conception.

### Input: What are the findings of Mason and Watts' study on search behavior and how does it relate to the concept of myopic search due to cognitive limitations?
### Response: Mason and Watts' study on search behavior found that empirical data significantly deviates from current models of search. This deviation seems to be partly due to an individual's ability to exploit local spatial correlations in the landscape. This finding challenges the concept of myopic search due to cognitive limitations, which suggests that individuals or organizations are limited in their search capabilities due to cognitive constraints. The study suggests that individuals are capable of more complex search behaviors than the myopic search model allows for.

### Response: The chunking algorithm for the hierarchical problem was developed based on the moves made by human solvers while attempting to solve the H-XOR problem. Two authors of the manuscript coded these moves to create an exhaustive list of ""possible moves"". These moves consist of manipulations of chunks or ""modules"" that are manipulated both individually and dependent on other chunks. The chunking hill-climbing algorithm was then developed around these moves.

### Input: What does the visualization of the ""chunking"" landscape and one-bit-flip landscape indicate about the underlying fitness function and the effectiveness of different problem representations in exploiting the problem structure?
### Response: The visualization indicates that the underlying fitness function is identical for both the ""chunking"" landscape and the one-bit-flip landscape. However, the ""chunking"" landscape appears to be smoother than the one-bit-flip landscape, and even more so than the bit string landscape. This suggests that the chunking algorithm is more effective at exploiting the problem structure, as it has a higher probability of connecting a given point in the landscape with a path to the global optimum. On the other hand, the one-bit-flip hill-climber is more likely to be ""deceptive"", meaning it may not lead to the global optimum. This indicates that the effectiveness of different problem representations can significantly impact the ability to exploit the problem structure.

### Input: What are the main concerns raised about the theoretical assumptions and empirical grounding of the simulation approach in organizational theory?
### Response: The main concerns raised about the theoretical assumptions and empirical grounding of the simulation approach in organizational theory are that they are often simplistic and weakly grounded in empirical evidence. The assumptions about agent behavior are often simplistic and embedded in a relatively undefined fitness landscape. Furthermore, defining human search behaviors and assessing the ruggedness of the fitness landscape in this conceptual framework are elusive tasks.

### Input: What challenges are presented by the one-bit-flip search assumption in the assessment of fitness landscapes?
### Response: The one-bit-flip search assumption presents several challenges in the assessment of fitness landscapes. First, the neighborhood function's influence on the ruggedness of the landscape cannot be overlooked. Second, traditional quantitative measurements face substantial challenges even under this assumption. This is because landscapes can be hierarchical and deceptive, and neutrality can influence how adaptive search unfolds in a given fitness landscape. Furthermore, there is limited understanding about the genotype-phenotype mapping in a technological setting, which complicates the assessment.

### Input: What is the role of hierarchical interdependence in creating a deceptive landscape in the WZ_heH-XOR function, and how does this relate to decision-making in organizations?
### Response: Hierarchical interdependence in the WZ_heH-XOR function creates a deceptive landscape by allowing subcomponents to be optimized independently or quasi-independently. This results in multiple optimal ways of combining the lower level building blocks, but the global optimum can only be found with awareness of the highest hierarchical level. This is related to decision-making in organizations because, as the text argues, hierarchical interdependence is an essential feature for organizations. Therefore, some level of deceptiveness is unavoidable. Understanding this can help make more sophisticated decisions about what kind of theoretical modeling assumptions to rely on in different situations.

Text: I. INTRODUCTION There have been several studies identifying challenges students have with building a conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics at both the undergraduate and graduate level [1–11].

Students also struggle with correctly describing the time evolution of a non- stationary state [2, 3, 12] and the real and imaginary parts of a stationary state [13]. Thus, tools that allow students to visualize and simulate quantum phenomena may foster bet- ter student understanding of challenging concepts in quantum mechanics.

### Input: What are the benefits of using Quantum Composer for students learning about quantum mechanical systems and how does it enhance their understanding of the subject?
### Response: Quantum Composer offers several benefits for students learning about quantum mechanical systems. It uses a flexible, drag-and-drop interface that allows students and instructors to build or modify simulations from the ground-up without any prior programming knowledge. This makes it accessible to a wide range of students. It can simulate a variety of one-dimensional quantum scenarios, and the statics and dynamics of problems can be explored through a large range of visualization tools. This allows students to interact with and visualize complex quantum concepts in a more tangible way. When students are presented with a pre-made simulation in Composer and surrounding exercise materials, they are able to use the visualization tools contained in the simulation to help build and reinforce their understanding of a problem. This hands-on, visual approach can enhance their understanding of the subject by making abstract concepts more concrete and understandable.

METHODOLOGY Research Context This study took place at Aarhus Univer- sity (AU), the second-largest university in Denmark, with ap- proximately 38,000 students enrolled in Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD programs. The student population is predominantly white and native to Denmark. For this study, we recruited These two authors contributed equally.students who were enrolled in a second-year undergradu- ate quantum mechanics for nanoscientists course, based on Grifﬁths’ textbook [28]. Nanoscience students typically take courses covering mechanics, thermodynamics, calculus, elec- trodynamics, waves, and optics before the quantum course.

Text: II. METHODOLOGY Research Context This study took place at Aarhus Univer- sity (AU), the second-largest university in Denmark, with ap- proximately 38,000 students enrolled in Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD programs. The student population is predominantly white and native to Denmark. For this study, we recruited These two authors contributed equally.students who were enrolled in a second-year undergradu- ate quantum mechanics for nanoscientists course, based on Grifﬁths’ textbook [28]. Nanoscience students typically take courses covering mechanics, thermodynamics, calculus, elec- trodynamics, waves, and optics before the quantum course. In addition, both students in this study also reported having had some introductory quantum mechanics in a physical chem- istry course taken concurrently with the quantum course. The quantum course was taught in English, and the study was in English, but all of the students who volunteered for our study spoke English as a second language. 
### Input: What prerequisite courses do nanoscience students typically take before enrolling in the quantum mechanics course at Aarhus University?
### Response: Nanoscience students typically take courses covering mechanics, thermodynamics, calculus, electrodynamics, waves, and optics before enrolling in the quantum mechanics course at Aarhus University.

Three times throughout the course, the students were given additional exercises built around Com- poser ﬂowscenes (see Fig.1). None of the exercises were graded. Students were provided with relevant ﬂowscenes, and the exercises were designed so that students did not have to build anything from scratch (although they were shown how this could be done). The ﬁrst set of exercises explored the in- ﬁnite and ﬁnite square well, the second set investigated super- position and expectation values, and the third discussed time- independent perturbation theory.

### Input: The study aimed to understand how students interact with a quantum mechanics simulation tool. The tool allowed students to manipulate various parameters such as the distance between wells, the number of eigenstates, and the coefficients of linear combinations. Students could also change time settings and play the time evolution of the system. The tool provided visualizations and displayed eigenvalues for the students to read and interpret. The researchers observed how students used the tool, noting when they asked for and received help, and how they understood the concepts presented. They also tracked the students' progress through the Predict, Explore, Revise framework, noting when students made predictions, explored the system, and revised their understanding.

It’s moving fast up and down and then slowly moving towards the other well, and not as ﬂuently (sic) as before because of the potential barrier in between the two wells, but still moving over there and after some time resetting itself...then moving back again at the same pace...if I lower [the spacing between wells], it would probably move faster...(0.5)...Yep. Moving remarkably faster...if we tried to set it at one, it would still move...(1)...it’s moving a little, just very, very, very slow. Okay, so the higher the spacing between the wells is, the harder it is for it to get to the other well...if we change this to 0.1, it should move back and forth almost in the [single-well] case from before. (0.1) Yep. Fluent (sic) motion back and forth, almost like with the one-well system.
### Input: What observations did Interviewee 1 make about the movement of a superposition state in relation to the spacing between wells?
### Response: Interviewee 1 observed that the movement of a superposition state initially localized to one of the two wells changes over time. They noted that when the well spacing is 0.75, the state moves slowly towards the other well, with its movement impeded by the potential barrier between the two wells. When the spacing is reduced to 0.5, the state moves remarkably faster. At a spacing of 1, the state still moves, but very slowly. Interviewee 1 concluded that the higher the spacing between the wells, the harder it is for the state to get to the other well. When the spacing is reduced to 0.1, the state moves back and forth almost as in the single-well case, with fluent motion.

### Input: What is the role of the Composer tool in helping students understand the behavior of a system and correct their predictions?
### Response: The Composer tool aids students in visualizing the behavior of a system, which in turn helps them to formulate an understanding of the system's dynamics. It also assists them in identifying new understandings not previously identified. In some cases, the Composer tool helps students recall what they have learned in class, allowing them to rethink incorrect predictions and make correct ones later in the exercise. For example, one student was able to use the tool to recall the concept of probability density and correct their initial misunderstanding about its behavior over time.

### Input: What does the statement by I2 suggest about the potential benefits of using the Composer program for student learning?
### Response: The statement by I2 suggests that the Composer program could potentially benefit student learning by allowing them to connect new information with prior knowledge, and by providing a more visual way of understanding concepts, which can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with more abstract or theoretical methods such as equations. The program also seems to facilitate a process of learning and understanding that continues even after using the program.

### Input: What challenges might artists face when using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation in terms of user control and alignment with human perception?
### Response: Artists might face challenges in terms of user control over GANs for image generation as the features of the generated image, which directly correspond with the internal state of the generator (its weights and biases), do not necessarily align with the features that a human would perceive. For instance, if a human intends to enhance a distinct shape from an image, the system might instead enhance a different feature that the user didn't even notice. This misalignment between the system's output and the user's intention can be frustrating and can limit the system's feasibility for creative processes.

2,4,"2.1 Presenting crea.blender crea.blender affords creativity by letting players “blend” existing images into new images. Using BigGAN [ 4], which has been trained on ImageNET [ 9], and by providing sets of between 3-6 source images, players can easily create a large number of new images bysimply adjusting how much of each source image will be blended in.crea.blender takes inspiration from one of the core aspects of creativity, constraint-based combinational creativity, which is here conceived visually as a means to achieve a creative outcome [6]. Having been trained on ImageNET, our neural network provides 1,000 different ""classes"" of objects, like cats, dogs, yachts, and people. By combining these, and adding a ""noise vector"" consisting of 128 floating point numbers, it is possible to produce billions and billions of different pictures, ranging from photo realistic to the macabre. While the generative range is limited by the training set, we believed this large combinatorial space would still sufficiently provide users with a feeling of creative freedom. Figure 1 Illustration of crea.blender’s mechanics When mix- ing images in crea.blender, players use sliders to indicate how much they want each image to contribute to the generated image. A vector is calculated from these weights and the underlying vector of each respective source image. This new vector is then passed into the GAN.

Using BigGAN [ 4], which has been trained on ImageNET [ 9], and by providing sets of between 3-6 source images, players can easily create a large number of new images bysimply adjusting how much of each source image will be blended in.crea.blender takes inspiration from one of the core aspects of creativity, constraint-based combinational creativity, which is here conceived visually as a means to achieve a creative outcome [6]. Having been trained on ImageNET, our neural network provides 1,000 different ""classes"" of objects, like cats, dogs, yachts, and people. By combining these, and adding a ""noise vector"" consisting of 128 floating point numbers, it is possible to produce billions and billions of different pictures, ranging from photo realistic to the macabre. While the generative range is limited by the training set, we believed this large combinatorial space would still sufficiently provide users with a feeling of creative freedom. Figure 1 Illustration of crea.blender’s mechanics When mix- ing images in crea.blender, players use sliders to indicate how much they want each image to contribute to the generated image. A vector is calculated from these weights and the underlying vector of each respective source image. This new vector is then passed into the GAN. Above we illustrate how two source images can produce two relatively differently looking images, depending on which is weighted higher.
### Input: What is the role of the ""noise vector"" in the crea.blender tool and how does it contribute to the generation of new images?
### Response: The ""noise vector"" in the crea.blender tool is a set of 128 floating point numbers that is added to the combination of different ""classes"" of objects. It plays a crucial role in the generation of new images by introducing variability and randomness, thereby expanding the range of possible outcomes. This allows the tool to produce billions of different pictures, from photo realistic to the macabre, contributing to the feeling of creative freedom for the users.

### Input: What are the three modes of crea.blender and what does each mode entail?
### Response: The three modes of crea.blender are Creatures, Challenge, and Open Play. In Creatures mode, players are given six images and asked to create as many different ""animal-like"" figures as possible in five minutes. In Challenge mode, players are presented with a target image and three sets of three source images. They must first determine which set was used to create the target image, and then recreate their closest approximation of the target image. There are three levels in this mode. In Open Play mode, players are given the same six source images as in Creatures mode, but they can create any image they find interesting during five minutes of playtime.

### Input: What are the differences in player behavior between the open play and creatures mode in crea.blender, and how do these compare to the challenge mode?
### Response: The text suggests that player behavior in crea.blender varies depending on the game mode. In the Creatures mode, which is associated with divergent thinking (DT), players tend to make larger changes to the image sliders, indicating a more open and explorative process. In contrast, the Challenge mode, associated with convergent thinking (CT), sees players making smaller changes to the sliders, suggesting an iterative process of narrowing down on a specific solution or idea. The Open Play mode seems to fall somewhere in between, with both small and large changes to sliders observed. Statistical tests revealed small but significant differences in behavior between the open play and creatures mode, and much more dramatic differences between these and the challenge mode.

Inspired by the growing set of AI-implementation failures in society at large, in this opinion piece we reexamine the field of Citizen Science (CitSci) through a computational lens, highlighting algorithmic opportunities as well as uniquely human capabilities. In particular, we situate the CitSci field among human and machine computation fields and introduce two novel dimensions allowing us to match CitSci projects ranging from digital games and annotation tasks to data collection in nature to the appropriate machine learning algorithms. Interestingly, in CitSci there is an abundance of tasks drawing upon human common sense, hierarchical thinking, and complex skills which have yet to be incorporated in current AI methods. This gap, combined with the unique participant-centered set of values, makes CitSci an invaluable test bed for the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century such as hybrid intelligence. The mapping thus offers concrete algorithm selection guides to CitSci researchers as well as inspiration for AI researchers to pursue grand AI challenges through support of CitSci projects.",Rafner et al. - 2022 - Mapping Citizen Science through the Lens of Human-,"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Rafner et al. / Human Computation (2022) 9:1    67      ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) can augment and sometimes even replace human cognition, but still has many fundamental roadblocks preventing it from achieving fully autonomous applications. Inspired by the growing set of AI-implementation failures in society at large, in this opinion piece we reexamine the field of Citizen Science (CitSci) through a computational lens, highlighting algorithmic opportunities as well as uniquely human capabilities. In particular, we situate the CitSci field among human and machine computation fields and introduce two novel dimensions allowing us to match CitSci projects ranging from digital games and annotation tasks to data collection in nature to the appropriate machine learning algorithms. Interestingly, in CitSci there is an abundance of tasks drawing upon human common sense, hierarchical thinking, and complex skills which have yet to be incorporated in current AI methods. This gap, combined with the unique participant-centered set of values, makes CitSci an invaluable test bed for the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century such as hybrid intelligence. The mapping thus offers concrete algorithm selection guides to CitSci researchers as well as inspiration for AI researchers to pursue grand AI challenges through support of CitSci projects.
### Input: What are the unique human capabilities that Citizen Science projects can offer to the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century?
### Response: The unique human capabilities that Citizen Science projects can offer to the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century include human common sense, hierarchical thinking, and complex skills.

### Input: What are some of the limitations and failures of autonomous deep learning-based approaches in real-world applications, and how does this make a case for Hybrid Intelligence in Citizen Science?
### Response: The limitations and failures of autonomous deep learning-based approaches in real-world applications include a lack of robustness to solve problems in noisy, unpredictable, and dynamically varying environments. There have been serious failures in visual recognition, chatbot training, and self-driving cars.

### Input: What is the degree of task digitization and how does it allow for a categorization of the possible AI-contribution?
### Response: The degree of task digitization refers to the extent to which a task can be converted into a digital form or can be performed digitally. This degree allows for a categorization of the possible AI-contribution into three main categories: robotics/smart sensors, supervised learning (SL), and reinforcement learning (RL). Robotics and smart sensors are used for tasks with a low degree of digitization, i.e., physical tasks in the real world.

Text: As outlined in the introduction, a key quality of HI as defined by Dellermann et al. (2019) is that mutual learning exists among the AI and human components of the system. Such integration not only allows for, but necessitates the co-evolution of individual components (AI and human alike) with each other and the systems to which they contribute. Thus, we are entering into uncharted AI territory, where our best hope for advancing the field may require bootstrapping. In other words, the potential complexity of these systems suggests an opportunity to use HI itself to improve our understanding of HI. Asking why a given CitSci project is not solved entirely algorithmically can be a path to identifying new modes of human-machine problem solving by discovering suitable existing machine technologies and as well as to deeper appreciation of the distinctly human contribution in areas where current machine technology falls short.
### Input: What potential opportunities could arise from using Human-Intelligence (HI) to improve our understanding of HI in the context of Citizen Science projects?
### Response: The potential opportunities that could arise from using Human-Intelligence (HI) to improve our understanding of HI in the context of Citizen Science projects include identifying new modes of human-machine problem solving and discovering suitable existing machine technologies. It could also lead to a deeper appreciation of the distinctly human contribution in areas where current machine technology falls short. This could further allow for the co-evolution of individual components (AI and human alike) with each other and the systems to which they contribute.

### Response: Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is a subset of the overlap between Human Computation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It can be achieved with only two agents, which is why it lies partially outside of Collective Intelligence that requires at least three agents. HI also has a substantial overlap with Citizen Science (CS) and AI, as well as an overlap of AI and Human Computation beyond the area of HI.

### Response: A self-contained model in the context of optimization tasks refers to a task that can be unambiguously and automatically evaluated or scored in terms of how well a candidate solution solves the problem without any further human input. This means that the task is fully defined and can be solved purely by machine computation. However, due to the high complexity of the solution space, these tasks may become intractable in practice. These types of tasks are well-suited to machine learning methods related to optimization in complex spaces, such as reinforcement learning.

### Response: The degree of digitization does not necessarily indicate an increase in cognitive complexity of tasks performed by human volunteers. While one might assume that solving complex mathematical problems (highly digitized tasks) represents the peak of human contribution, the text suggests that physical tasks assisted or replaced by robotics/smart sensors (less digitized tasks) can be more challenging, given the current state of robotics technology. A systematic comparison with modern computational capabilities can enhance our understanding of this by highlighting the range of tasks that human volunteers perform and how their labor interacts with technology and machine learning. This comparison can also help identify areas where technology is less advanced and where human contribution is still crucial.

### Input: What are the two ways in which machine agents assist participants in the solution of tasks in Foldit, and how does this combination of human and machine interaction provide superior results in complex problems like Quantum Moves 2?
### Response: Machine agents assist participants in the solution of tasks in Foldit in two ways. First, they optimize a participant’s solution with small tweaks using an optimization algorithm initiated by the participant. Second, the Foldit software assists the participant by continuously calculating a variety of assessment criteria for the protein that the participant is currently folding, providing the participant with additional information through continuous feedback.

In complex problems like Quantum Moves 2, this combination of human and machine interaction provides superior results. Players can engage a local optimizer starting from their hand-drawn solution. The combination of human seeding with machine optimization has been shown to provide superior results compared to individual machine agents. This is because humans can provide creative and intuitive solutions, while machines can refine these solutions with precise calculations and optimizations.

### Input: What is the importance of understanding differentiation for students pursuing higher education in science, according to Mads Kock Pedersen et al.?
### Response: According to Mads Kock Pedersen et al., understanding differentiation is crucial for students pursuing higher education in science. This is because it allows them to calculate the rate of change of a quantity with respect to time and obtain the acceleration, which is proportional to the force according to Newton’s Second law. Therefore, it is a fundamental concept in understanding and solving complex problems in science.

2,2,"One way to facilitate students’ independent investigation of di fferentiation-problems is through games. In an educational context games have the ability to make lear ning more entertaining and motivate students without compromising the learning (Muntean, 2011). Abstract conten t which could otherwise be incomprehensible can in games be conveyed though simple visual representations and interactions (Bjælde et al., 2014; Magnusen et al., 2014; Pedersen et al., 2016).  The simple visual representations combined with the game elements allow students to obtain an intuition even for systems which do not have any analogies to their daily life (Lieberoth et al., 2015). Games can be designed such that students are presented with problems in an environment that allows them to make mistakes and reflect upon them. The flow-in-game infused learning can be designed to adapt to the individual students’ level of skill in order to provide training in the mo st beneficial areas.

Text: One way to facilitate students’ independent investigation of di fferentiation-problems is through games. In an educational context games have the ability to make lear ning more entertaining and motivate students without compromising the learning (Muntean, 2011). Abstract conten t which could otherwise be incomprehensible can in games be conveyed though simple visual representations and interactions (Bjælde et al., 2014; Magnusen et al., 2014; Pedersen et al., 2016).  The simple visual representations combined with the game elements allow students to obtain an intuition even for systems which do not have any analogies to their daily life (Lieberoth et al., 2015). Games can be designed such that students are presented with problems in an environment that allows them to make mistakes and reflect upon them. The flow-in-game infused learning can be designed to adapt to the individual students’ level of skill in order to provide training in the mo st beneficial areas. Such dynamically differentiated learning (Algozzine & Anderson, 2007) is enabled by giving students, who have troubles with a specific type of problems, extra opportunities to train, while allowing those, who have mastered the problems, to proceed. Thus, students will mostly work in their zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978); continually challenged to the border of their current abilities but with scaffolds like tuto ring and feedback in place to keep the learning trajectory moving forward (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976).

### Input: What are the benefits of using games in teaching differentiation problems and how do they align with the visible learning theory?
### Response: The benefits of using games in teaching differentiation problems include making learning more entertaining and motivating for students, conveying abstract content through simple visual representations and interactions, and allowing students to develop an intuition for complex systems. Games also provide an environment where students can make mistakes and reflect upon them, and can be designed to adapt to individual students' skill levels, providing training in the most beneficial areas. This aligns with the visible learning theory in several ways. The games welcome errors as learning opportunities, assess the students' current abilities to determine the next step in the learning process, provide a clear goal for students to fulfill, and can be designed so that both teachers and students can easily track progress.

### Input: What is the primary aim of the DiffGame and how does it cater to different tiers of students in terms of their understanding of differentiation?
### Response: The primary aim of DiffGame is to introduce the basic principles of differentiation to high-school students through game-like elements. The game is designed in such a way that it requires no previous knowledge about differentiation, making it accessible to beginners. However, it can also be used to refresh the differentiation knowledge of students at later stages of their education. The game caters to different tiers of students by dividing them into lower, middle, or upper tiers based on their overall performance in DiffGame. Their learning gains are then compared, allowing for an assessment of how the game benefits students of varying levels of understanding and knowledge.

### Input: What could be the reason for the middle tier students displaying the largest gain in the second test, contradicting previous studies where the weakest students demonstrated the largest gains?
### Response: The text suggests that the large gains for the middle tier students could stem from a training effect that familiarizes students with the format rather than creating transferable skills and understandings. This training effect might favor students who already have some understanding of the math involved, while making it more difficult for those who are dealing with both a new learning format and a task that would have been challenging for them regardless.

### Response: The predicted outcome of a controlled test on the DiffGame curriculum is that it will yield large immediate gains. However, it will require some effort to align and transfer this with other modes of learning. In terms of student motivation, the text suggests that while students generally found the games to be fun and useful, the tests could not establish a relationship between high levels of performance and intrinsic motivation. This suggests that extrinsic motivation was also a significant factor driving participation. The game-inspired design elements like interactivity, feedback, and clear goals help to scaffold students to work on every task.

Text: Introduction Individual cognitive phenotyping holds the potential to revolutionize various domains ranging from personalized learning to precision psychology and the job market of the 21st century. To get there it will require us to rethink how we study and measure cognitive abilities. Most of what social scientists know about cognitive abilities and psychological behaviour has been gleaned from studying university undergraduates in the laboratory. It has become clear, however, that many of these – often underpowered – results may not generalize across populations, let alone to samples from non-Western cultures. The social sciences are therefore undergoing a revolution to increase the diversity of those studied1. Furthermore, in-person testing is costly, inconvenient to participants, and sometimes confounded by issues such as experimenter expectations and behaviours2. Until these problems are solved, individual cognitive phenotyping and ambitions such as precision psychiatry will remain an illusion.
### Input: What are the challenges and limitations of current methods in studying and measuring cognitive abilities, and how might they impact the development of individual cognitive phenotyping and precision psychiatry?
### Response: The current methods of studying and measuring cognitive abilities face several challenges and limitations. Firstly, most of the knowledge about cognitive abilities and psychological behavior is derived from studying university undergraduates in the laboratory. This approach may not yield results that are generalizable across different populations, especially those from non-Western cultures. Secondly, in-person testing, which is commonly used, is not only costly and inconvenient for participants, but also potentially confounded by issues such as experimenter expectations and behaviors. These limitations could hinder the development of individual cognitive phenotyping and precision psychiatry by providing a skewed or incomplete understanding of cognitive abilities. Until these problems are addressed, ambitions such as precision psychiatry and individual cognitive phenotyping may remain unattainable.

### Response: The text suggests this as a question, but does not provide a definitive answer. It highlights the success of projects like Sea Hero Quest and The Great Brain Experiment in gathering large-scale cognitive ability data, but also notes that these studies have relied on small, laboratory-based validation samples.

### Input: What is the correlation between cognitive abilities and entrepreneurial intention according to the survey?
### Response: According to the survey, there is a negative correlation between cognitive abilities and entrepreneurial intention. This means that people with higher cognitive abilities are less likely to have an interest in starting their own business. The correlation was confirmed with a value of r = -0.09, p = 0.01, n = 720. However, it was also found that people with greater variation in cognitive abilities had higher entrepreneurial intention.

### Input: How does integrating data on lower-level cognitive abilities challenge the Jack-of-all-trade theory’s distinction between generalists vs. specialists in the context of entrepreneurship?
### Response: The integration of data on lower-level cognitive abilities challenges the Jack-of-all-trade theory’s distinction between generalists vs. specialists in the context of entrepreneurship by suggesting that individuals with greater variation in cognitive abilities are more likely to find a better match in entrepreneurship. This implies that it's not just about being a generalist or a specialist, but rather having a diverse range of cognitive skills that can be applied flexibly, which is a characteristic of entrepreneurs. This expands our understanding of what it means to be an entrepreneur beyond the traditional generalist vs. specialist dichotomy.

### Input: What is the core challenge in generating data for citizen science projects and how does the concept of ""churn rate"" relate to this issue?
### Response: The core challenge in generating data for citizen science projects is to produce data of sufficient quantity and quality. The concept of ""churn rate"" relates to this issue as it refers to the probability of participants disengaging from the project. This disengagement can lead to a decrease in the quantity of data collected, as fewer participants are contributing to the project. Furthermore, if the participants who disengage are those with higher levels of expertise, this could also impact the quality of the data collected.

### Input: What methods have been explored in citizen science and video game research to increase player engagement and data contribution in games, and how have these methods been applied in specific projects or competitions?
### Response: Citizen science and video game research have explored various methods to increase player engagement and data contribution in games. One method is the use of user interfaces, investigated through design experimentation either through natural or deliberate experiments. However, the ideal approach should be based on intricate knowledge of individual player behavior in specific games. For instance, Gal et al. used a player model-based method to display motivational messages to users at the optimal moment to increase their play-time. They applied this method using reinforcement learning on data from Galaxy Zoo, one of the largest citizen science platforms.

In video game research, sophisticated approaches have been explored. For example, the winning team of the IEEE CIG 2017 Game Data Mining Competition used deep neural networks to predict the remaining lifetime of each player using real-world data. In another instance, machine learning models were used to predict the churn rate, the expected expenses, or the fun of the player to adapt the game experience. These methods have been applied to adapt the game experience based on the predicted player behavior.

Text: Our discovery and achievement probability network also gives insight into why people keep  playing the game. Indeed, figure 3  shows the transition m atrix of the model demonstrating both  positive and negative correlations. The two circled dependencies represent examples of causal  inferences. The bottom one indicates that achieving milestones reduces the chances that the player  leaves the game just after, and the top one indicates that achieving a milestone increases the chance  of reaching a better milestone just after. 5Saurou et al.
### Input: What does the transition matrix in the discovery and achievement probability network indicate about the player's likelihood to continue playing the game after achieving milestones?
### Response: The transition matrix in the discovery and achievement probability network indicates that achieving milestones reduces the chances that the player will leave the game immediately after. It also suggests that achieving a milestone increases the chance of the player reaching a better milestone soon after.

1,2,"ABSTRACT In this paper, we explore the potential of AI-assisted visualization during the problem identification and construction phase of the creative problem-solving process. We examine this within the con- text of the ongoing crea.visions research project, which employs AI technologies to visualize citizens’ visions of the future. Our find- ings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as: 1) the tool’s dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhance- ment of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limita- tions related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts.

Text: ABSTRACT In this paper, we explore the potential of AI-assisted visualization during the problem identification and construction phase of the creative problem-solving process. We examine this within the con- text of the ongoing crea.visions research project, which employs AI technologies to visualize citizens’ visions of the future. Our find- ings underscore various factors contributing to the effectiveness of assisted visualization in this setting, such as: 1) the tool’s dual role as both a visual and ideational aid, 2) the introduction of innovative collaborative elements like prompt engineering, 3) the enhance- ment of visual expression without requiring artistic skills, and 4) the facilitation of idea communication. We also recognize limita- tions related to the tool and the problem context such as abstract concepts. This study serves as a foundation for future research on AI-assisted image generation as a resource in creative problem- solving, laying the groundwork for the creation of increasingly effective and user-friendly tools.

### Input: What is the significance of problem identification and construction in addressing real-world challenges such as climate change and socio-cultural issues, and how can public engagement in CPS be explored given the recent surge in fields that actively involve the public in research and development?
### Response: Problem identification and construction is significant in addressing real-world challenges such as climate change and socio-cultural issues because these complex, ill-defined problems often require adaptable problem representations and analogical reasoning. This means that understanding the problem in its entirety and constructing it in a way that allows for flexible solutions is crucial. 

Public engagement in CPS (Creative Problem Solving) can be explored given the recent surge in fields that actively involve the public in research and development through various means. This includes citizen science, public participation in research, participatory design, and participatory futures. These fields provide opportunities for the public to contribute their unique perspectives and skills, potentially leading to more diverse and innovative solutions. This shift towards public involvement in problem-solving represents a significant opportunity to leverage collective intelligence in addressing complex global issues.

2,4,"3 DESIGN OF CREA.VISIONS PARIS: INTEGRATING GAN AND STABLE DIFFUSION MODALITIES Broadly, the crea.visions tool aims to assist the public in envisioning possible futures. Crea.visions was first developed in 2020 and has undergone four design iterations [ 22,23]. The newest iteration, crea.visions Paris, is specifically designed to facilitate CPS around complex socio-scientific and cultural issues. The tool features a two-step interaction (see Figure 1): first, a GAN-based application developed in the game engine Unity, which allows users to blend the style and content of source images, creating new images. The content refers to large-scale features and shapes (e.g., buildings, trees) while the style captures small-scale features and texture of other images. Users are presented with four source images that can be freely ‘swapped’ with alternative images (125 possible images). Users adjust sliders to manipulate the style and content of the four source images. The limits in scope and granularity of detail in the GAN generated images inspired the incorporation of a second step using stable diffusion, which allows users to create images using text prompts. We used the model implemented on playground.ai in the crea.visions iteration presented here. This feature (stable diffusion) allows users to add a higher level of detail and incorporate specific components, such as impresionist style or smoke, which were not possible with the GAN-based system alone, while the GAN model ensures base images represent diverse aspects of a specific, contextually relevant location (in this case, Paris, France), not just iconic landmarks or tourist attractions. This is crucial for the experiment, as Parisian participants ideated about problems they encounter daily, which extend beyond popular tourist spots. Initial testing revealed that stable diffusion mode alone produced images focused on iconic Paris locations. For the GAN component, the StyleGAN model was retrained [ 15] on images from the online platform Artbreeder [ 17] and Parisian buildings. In order to maintain the diversity of the pre-trained StyleGAN model and achieve the continuous building-like latent space needed for this application, the standard training procedure for StyleGAN was used. The retraining set was composed of 3,237 images, 2,744 of which were crowdsourced photos taken of Paris by our local partners.

### Response: The text mentions two games designed for cognitive assessment: Sea Hero Quest and The Great Brain Experiment. Sea Hero Quest, which has reached 2.5 million participants, is designed to measure spatial navigation. It has provided insights into spatial navigation impairments in adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, The Great Brain Experiment is a collection of smaller games that assess multiple cognitive abilities. It has provided new insights into age-related changes in working memory performance and patterns of bias in information-seeking behavior.

Text: Since many tasks conceptually measure aspects of the same cognitive abilities, combiningthe observations from different tasks with a strong theoretical overlap can give rise to morerobust composite measures of cognitive abilities. Measures of cognitive abilities from taskscan be deﬁned on a spectrum of computational granularity; pure indicators (Salthouse, 2011),linear combinations of indicators (Bollen & Bauldry, 2011), all the way to methods like gen-erative models (Guest & Martin, 2021). Here, we form linear combinations of indicators,combining indicators from multiple tasks according to a standard theoretical interpretation,as it is the simplest way to take advantage of the overlap among the indicators. We recog-nize that the association between any particular combination of indicators is open to debateand offer the speciﬁc aggregation of indicators here as the most straightforward theoreticalproposal. (For a list of the standard task indicators associated with each of the 13 cognitiveabilities, see Supplementary Information Section 6).
### Input: What is the simplest way to take advantage of the overlap among indicators of cognitive abilities from different tasks, according to the text?
### Response: The simplest way to take advantage of the overlap among indicators of cognitive abilities from different tasks, according to the text, is to form linear combinations of indicators, combining indicators from multiple tasks according to a standard theoretical interpretation.

### Input: What is the purpose of ridge and lasso regression in the elastic net model described by M. K. Pedersen et al.?
### Response: The purpose of ridge and lasso regression in the elastic net model described by M. K. Pedersen et al. is to prevent overfitting. Ridge regression does this by shrinking the values of the collinear coefficients closer to zero, effectively grouping collinear game indicators. Lasso regression, on the other hand, forces some of the coefficients to be exactly zero, enabling automatic variable selection. The elastic net model increases the reliability of the model over ordinary least squares regressions, as it can handle multi-collinearity among the indicators by shrinking the coefficients or zeroing redundant indicators.

### Response: The primary focus when generating a predictive model of cognitive abilities using the elastic-net model is to increase the reliability of the model so that it can be used with new participant samples. One must be cautious when interpreting the coefficients resulting from this model because a small or zero coefficient could be either a redundant or irrelevant indicator.

### Input: What did the factor analysis reveal about the correlation between game-based cognitive measures and task-based measures in the study?
### Response: The factor analysis revealed a main factor for cognitive abilities that could be interpreted as a general cognitive ability for both games and tasks. This suggests a correlation between game-based cognitive measures and task-based measures. However, the shared information from the main factor was insufficient to explain a substantial proportion of each cognitive ability’s observed agreement between task and game estimates.

### Response: The current study is limited in that participants were only recruited to play the game once. This could potentially affect the robustness of the cognitive ability estimates. To improve the robustness of these estimates in future studies, a follow-up test-retest study could be conducted. This would involve controlling the time between playthroughs to neutralize learning effects and ensuring all the games have been played in both playthroughs. Additionally, more consistent estimates could potentially be achieved by training models dependent on the playthrough number, which would compensate for learning effects due to the player familiarizing themselves with the tasks.

21,3,"In conclusion, the models developed through our work with Skill Lab illustrate the viability of a crowdsourcing approach in validating a cognitive assessment tool, which has several key implications. First, it allows scientists to create better human cognition models and test and validate cognitive abilities, potentially providing efﬁcient ways to scale insights into particular cognitive abilities and how they are related to solving problems (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone, 2010). Second, we have generated a unique and open data set, which includes normative benchmarks, that can be used as a basis for other studies. Finally, Skill Lab allows normative data for diverse populations, cultures, and languages to be collected in the future, facilitating the much-needed broadening of the samples typically tested in psychological and social science studies (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). An advantage of Skill Lab over traditional tests is that it is faster to play all six games once than to go through all the traditional cognitive tasks. Thus, the games could provide a low-cost self-administered test suitable for extensive deployment.

### Response: The key implications of using a crowdsourcing approach in validating a cognitive assessment tool, as illustrated by the models developed through work with Skill Lab, include the ability for scientists to create better human cognition models and test and validate cognitive abilities. This could potentially provide efficient ways to scale insights into specific cognitive abilities and their relation to problem-solving. The approach also allows for the generation of a unique and open data set, including normative benchmarks, that can be used as a basis for other studies. Furthermore, Skill Lab allows for the collection of normative data for diverse populations, cultures, and languages in the future, facilitating a much-needed broadening of the samples typically tested in psychological and social science studies. An additional advantage is that Skill Lab is faster and less burdensome to administer than traditional cognitive tests, making it a low-cost, self-administered test suitable for extensive deployment, such as in the psychiatric sector.
