Storytelling for Culturo-Scienti\ufb01c Thinking We believe that developing these traits at an early stage of students\u2019 careers should be considered one of the core goals of scienti\ufb01c outreach. Our philosophy is that students should be offered the chance to develop an interest in science and think like a modern scientist, able to actively engage with a rapidly developing society. In support of this, activities should be designed which re\ufb02ect and provide opportunities for engaging with the scienti\ufb01c thinking process. They should enable students to themselves be scientists during the activity, by experimenting and observing phenomena, making sense of them creatively, and building theory to describe them. This element of role-play serves to centre the activity on the participants, with associated bene\ufb01ts for engagement [ 58], social development [ 59], and conceptual learning [ 60]. These bene\ufb01ts are well worth the effort required to engage participants with the scienti\ufb01c method of inquiry [61].\n### Input: What are the benefits of incorporating role-play and active engagement in scientific outreach activities for students?\n### Response: The benefits of incorporating role-play and active engagement in scientific outreach activities for students include increased engagement, social development, and conceptual learning.\n\n"}

To put patients at the center, co-creation with patients has recently emerged as a promising method for developing innovative medical solutions. One of the pioneering projects is PATIO (PATient Involvement in Oncology), aiming to involve prostate cancer patients and people indirectly affected by the disease in research. Yet adequately addressing each of the co-creators\u2019 needs and expectations while running against time (the patients\u2019 average age at diagnosis is beyond 70 years) leads to critical tensions. Consequently, we ask: (1) How can we effectively involve patients in co-creation activities? (2) How can we co-design with patients to rapidly prototype and test concept ideas? (3) How can we conduct projects with communities of patients, caregivers, or relatives with different vulnerabilities in an ethical and responsible way? To tackle these questions, the proposal outlines participatory co-design methods, as the lead user method and experimental studies with different groups.\n### Input: What are some potential strategies for effectively involving patients in co-creation activities within the medical research field, while also addressing their unique needs and expectations in an ethical and responsible manner?\n### Response: The proposal suggests using participatory co-design methods and the lead user method to effectively involve patients in co-creation activities. This approach would allow patients to actively contribute to the development of innovative medical solutions. Additionally, conducting experimental studies with different groups, including patients, caregivers, and relatives, could help address the unique needs and expectations of each individual. This approach would also ensure that the research is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, taking into account the different vulnerabilities of each group.\n\n"}

Despite inviting end-users who faced real-world problems within their particular fields to co-develop the proposals, there was no pre-defined connection to societal implications or benefits. Focusing specifically on societal problems, however, could make the co-development process a powerful tool to develop research proposals that better address societal challenges. In the future, this type of experimentation process could be carried out in creative multi-disciplinary spaces (e.g., CERN IdeaSquare, Living Labs, Design Factories). Such innovation spaces could lead to exciting use-inspired research proposals that pave the way for scientific breakthroughs and unexpected innovations. The fact that such creative spaces are also inhabited by students and young researchers could lead to interesting opportunities to further develop the resulting research proposals into actual projects. Linking co-development of research challenges with users working toward particular Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., SDGs) is already being tested at IdeaSquare and at the Aalto Design Factory as part of the ATTRACT initiative (Wareham et al. 2021, ATTRACT student projects, 2021). Another option would be to implement the co-development process in PhD training programs. For example, senior scholars could be engaged as mentors with students working toward particular SDGs as well as potential users. Such efforts can further extend pioneering projects that are already taking place as Challenge-Based Innovation student projects at CERN and at sites like the Aalto Design Factory (Product Development Project 2021).\n### Input: What are some potential benefits of implementing the co-development process in PhD training programs and how could this be linked to Sustainable Development Goals?\n### Response: The text suggests that implementing the co-development process in PhD training programs could lead to the development of research proposals that better address societal challenges.

The infrastructures of research organisations, defined in terms of support services and technical systems that underpin core functions like research and teaching, can both support and hinder OIS activities. Over time, specialised infrastructures have evolved to act as agents in knowledge and technology transfer processes (Geuna and Muscio 2009 ). In particular, Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) have attracted a great deal of attention in innovation studies. The TTO\u2019s role is, loosely, that of a boundary spanner or broker between academia and industry, helping academic scientists to understand the needs of industry and providing support for commercialisation activities, partner search and match, management of intellectual property, and new venture development (O\u2019Kane et al. 2015 ; Siegel, Waldman, and Link 2003 ). \n### Input: What is the role of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) in the infrastructures of research organisations and how do they support Open Innovation Systems (OIS) activities?\n### Response: Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) play a crucial role in the infrastructures of research organisations.

Disciplinary differences regarding OIS practices. While scholars have moved away from strongly essentialist approaches to conceptualising disciplines (Trowler 2014 ), these social formations continue to shape scientists\u2019 ways of working and thinking (Becher and Parry 2005 ; Leisyte and Dee 2012 ). This includes their outlook on specific OIS practices, as well as scientific openness and collaboration more generally. Some researchers have investigated the meanings and implications of openness for scholars in particular disciplines (Kn\u00f6chelmann 2019 ; Levin and Leonelli 2017 ). Others have examined the relative likelihood of scientists in different fields to engage in particular practices. For instance, studies of university-industry collaboration consistently reveal that fields including the applied sciences and parts of the social sciences, such as economics and management studies, are more prone to collaborations with the private sector, patenting, and spinout formation (e.g. Azagra-Caro, Carayol, and Llerena 2006 ; Bozeman 2000 ; 154 S. BECK ET AL.\n### Input: What are the disciplinary differences regarding Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices among scientists in different fields?\n### Response: The text suggests that disciplinary differences regarding Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices among scientists in different fields are influenced by their ways of working and thinking. These differences can affect their outlook on specific OIS practices, as well as their approach to scientific openness and collaboration. For example, researchers in applied sciences and certain social sciences like economics and management studies are more likely to engage in collaborations with the private sector, patenting, and spinout formation. However, the text does not provide specific details on how these disciplinary differences manifest in OIS practices across all scientific fields.\n\n"}

This methodol - ogy represents a major roadblock for the scaling up of  these kinds of initiatives. Building off of the literature around consensual assess - ment, crowdsourced peer rating of in-game produced  products may present a solution to this problem. When  gameplay is simple enough that anyone can learn within  a relatively short period of time to distinguish various  characteristics of a set of solutions\/products, crowd - sourced peer assessment could be a promising method  for scalable creative product assessment. An example of  implementation of consensual assessment based on peer  feedback could be asking a player to rank on a Likert scale  how creative is a product (or solution) produced by  another player. It is recommended that such assessment  comes after a player has completed a tutorial\/introduction  and has tried the game themself, so that they are aware of  how difficult\/rare it is to make certain products. If crowd - sourced, these products could have many peer raters, with  a subset of products cross-validated by expert raters.  Crowdsourced assessment could be employed as long as  wording at the point of creation is identical to wording at  the point of rating (e.g., \u201cMake a creative shape,\u201d and  \u201cWhich shape is more creative?,\u201d respectively). Notably,  peer assessment was not addressed in any of the reviewed  papers. Combining creativity information from products  via crowdsourcing and processes via stealth assessment  could possibly result in stronger construct validity of an  instrument.\n### Input: What is the potential solution to the problem of algorithmic scoring of open-ended responses or products, as suggested in the text?\n### Response: The potential solution to the problem of algorithmic scoring of open-ended responses or products, as suggested in the text, is crowdsourced peer rating of in-game produced products. This method could be implemented by asking a player to rank on a Likert scale how creative a product (or solution) produced by another player is.\n\n"}

One way of quantitatively measuring the locality of a landscape is a fitness distance correlation coefficient [53]: \u03c1 FDC = Cfd \u03c3(f)\u03c3dopt, where C fd = 1m \u2211mi=1 fi\u2212f \udbff\udf01di,opt\u2212dopt, with f as the mean value for the fitness function, d opt as the mean value for the distance to the optimal solution, f i as the fitness value for solution i, and d i,opt as the distance of solution i to the optimal solution x \u2217. \u03c1FDC is thus the Pearson-correlation between the distance to the optimal solution and the fitness value.\n### Input: What is the formula for measuring the locality of a landscape in terms of fitness distance correlation coefficient?\n### Response: The formula for measuring the locality of a landscape in terms of fitness distance correlation coefficient is \u03c1 FDC = Cfd \u03c3(f)\u03c3dopt, where C fd = 1m \u2211mi=1 fi\u2212f \udbff\udf01di,opt\u2212dopt.\n\n"}

It involves a supervising function that is linked with the frontal activation and is essential for successful problem-solving (Dockery, Hueckel-Weng, Birbaumer, & Plewnia, 2009). Planning is often viewed as a subcomponent of executive functioning (Carlson, Moses, & Claxton, 2004; Krikorian, Bartok, & Gay, 1994).\n### Input: What is the relationship between planning and executive functioning, and why is it essential for successful problem-solving?\n### Response: The text suggests that planning is often viewed as a subcomponent of executive functioning. This means that planning is a part of the broader cognitive process of executive functioning, which involves managing and regulating various cognitive processes. Planning is essential for successful problem-solving because it involves the ability to anticipate and plan actions, monitor goal attainment, and update plans mid-execution if necessary. This supervising function, linked with frontal activation, allows for the effective management and adjustment of actions to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n"}

For example, to increase the reusability of  research data that has been shared via repositories or other open mechanisms, leaders  at the 2016 G20 Summit signed a document supporting the adoption of the \u2018FAIR  Guiding Principles of Scientific Data Management and Stewardship\u2019 (Wilkinson et al.  2016 ), which were later formally endorsed by the European Commission. Political  support for making research data across Europe findable, accessible, interoperable, and  reusable (FAIR) was thus translated into technical specifications for metadata,  approaches to identification and indexing, protocols for access, and appropriate attri- butes for identifying provenance. Further efforts to support data sharing and reuse  include the European Open Science Cloud, an ambitious effort to connect national-  level infrastructures in an effort to harmonise data management according to FAIR  principles, and the COVID-19 Data Platform, launched in April 2020 to bring together  relevant datasets and accelerate research responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\n### Input: What are some of the efforts made in Europe to increase the reusability of research data and support data sharing?\n### Response: Some of the efforts made in Europe to increase the reusability of research data and support data sharing include the adoption of the \u2018FAIR Guiding Principles of Scientific Data Management and Stewardship\u2019 which were endorsed by the European Commission.

To answer this question, citizen science scholars have investigated the efficiency of user  inter-faces using design experimentation either through natural [12] or deliberate experiments,   [13] but ideally such considerations should be based on intricate knowledge of individual player  behavior in specific games [14, 15]. As an example, Gal et al. [14] presented a player model- based method to displaying motivational messages to users at the optimal moment to increase  their play-time. They used reinforcement learning on data from Galaxy Zoo, one of the largest  citizen science platforms. In the video game research literature other sophisticated approaches  have been explored. For in-stance, the winning team of the IEEE CIG 2017  Game Data Mining  Competition [16] used deep neural networks to predict the remaining lifetime of each player  using real world data. In another example, machine learning models predict the churn rate, the  expected expenses or the fun of the player to adapt the game experience [17, 18].\n### Input: What methods have been explored in citizen science and video game research to increase player engagement and data contribution in games, and how have these methods been applied in specific projects or competitions?\n### Response: Citizen science and video game research have explored various methods to increase player engagement and data contribution in games.

Concluding Thoughts In this article, we have conceived of a structure for storytelling through outreach: theculturo-scienti\ufb01c narrative. This approach takes participants on a journey through the discipline-culture of the \ufb01eld in question, drawing them in with unexplainable knowledge from the periphery of the \ufb01eld, which may be deeply at odds with their internal model. In interpreting a paradigm by which this can be understood, curiosity is engaged and participants are able to access the working applications of the \ufb01eld. Finally, with the dual entry and exit through the periphery, where knowledge cannot be fully explained, participants are directly exposed to the reality of being a scientist: there is always more to learn, and no discipline-culture is ever \u201ccomplete\u201d. By engaging participants through this narrative, outreach offers the opportunity to act as more than an educational activity, by becoming a role-playing tool wherein students are scientists themselves for the duration, exercising scienti\ufb01c thinking throughout. The resulting skills, culturo-scienti\ufb01c thinking , are of essential importance in present society, currently undergoing a second quantum revolution. Our observations echo those observed in the context of climate change [ 58]. Skills, not just disciplinary knowledge,\n### Input: What is the role of the culturo-scientific narrative in engaging participants in scientific outreach and how does it contribute to the development of scientific thinking skills?\n### Response: The culturo-scientific narrative in scientific outreach engages participants by taking them on a journey through the discipline-culture of a particular field. It draws them in with knowledge from the periphery of the field, which may challenge their existing understanding or models. This approach stimulates curiosity and allows participants to understand and access the working applications of the field. The narrative also exposes participants to the reality of being a scientist, emphasizing that there is always more to learn and no discipline-culture is ever complete. This engagement through the narrative allows outreach to act as a role-playing tool, where students become scientists themselves for the duration, exercising scientific thinking throughout. This contributes to the development of scientific thinking skills, or culturo-scientific thinking, which are essential in the current society, especially in the context of the ongoing second quantum revolution.\n\n"}

The program also seems to facilitate a process of learning and understanding that continues even after using the program.\n\n"}

In each step of the simulation, the agent follows prespecified search rules, in an attempt to find the optimal solution, i.e., the peak of the fitness landscape. The landscape is a mapping between solutions and fitness values which takes into account the connectivity between solutions in the search space. But, in order to define this connectivity, we need to specify a distance metric that informs how agents can move between different positions in the search space. Different distance metrics lead to different landscape structures, a topic we will return to later. Complexity.\n### Input: What are the two main elements in the fitness landscape model that need to be specified for problem-solving processes?\n### Response: The two main elements in the fitness landscape model that need to be specified for problem-solving processes are the task structure (the problem that is to be solved) and the search behavior (how problem-solving unfolds).\n\n"}

Industry actors as co-creators in the scientific research process. While the commercialisation of scientific knowledge can be undertaken by academic scientists themselves (e.g. through science-based start-ups), much market-oriented knowledge transfer involves partnering with industry actors to co-create and apply scientific research. These OIS practices vary in terms of the level of interaction with existing industry actors. For example, while spinouts and patenting or licencing activities typically require lower levels of engagement, university-industry collaborations can cover the entire spectrum from contributory to co-creative interactions (Perkmann et al. 2013 ).\n### Input: What are the different levels of interaction with industry actors in the process of commercializing scientific research?\n### Response: The different levels of interaction with industry actors in the process of commercializing scientific research can vary from lower levels of engagement, such as through spinouts and patenting or licensing activities, to more involved university-industry collaborations that can cover the entire spectrum from contributory to co-creative interactions.\n\n"}

The Go\/No -Go task measures Response Inhibition, Baseline Reaction Time, and Choice Reaction Time (when facing distractors) by presenting a participant with a series of stimuli. If the stimulus is the correct colour, then the participant must react as quickly as possible; otherwise, the participant must refrain from reacting. This test procedure is mirrored in the first two levels of Rat Catch. In the first level, a rat appears for a limited time at a random position; the player must tap the rat as quickly as possible, providing measures of Baseline Reaction Time. The rats disappear faster and faster as the level progresses; when the player has missed three rats, they are sent to the next level.\n### Input: What is the relationship between the Go\/No-Go task and the Rat Catch game in terms of measuring Baseline Reaction Time?\n### Response: The Go\/No-Go task and the Rat Catch game both measure Baseline Reaction Time by requiring the participant or player to react as quickly as possible to a specific stimulus. In the Go\/No-Go task, the participant must react quickly if the stimulus is the correct color. In the Rat Catch game, the player must tap the rat as quickly as possible when it appears.\n\n"}

Cognitive \ufb02exibility is vital in life, as we are faced with situations that require multitasking or rapid task switching every day. When talking about cognitive \ufb02exibility, the concept of switching costs is fundamental. Studies show that switching back and forth between tasks can harm productivity. On the other hand, task switching can be bene\ufb01cial when stuck, as it can increase creativity by decreasing cognitive \ufb01xation (Geurts, Corbett, & Solomon, 2009; Lu, Akinola, & Mason, 2017; Monsell, 2003).\n### Input: What is the concept of switching costs in relation to cognitive flexibility and how does it affect productivity and creativity?\n### Response: The concept of switching costs in relation to cognitive flexibility refers to the potential negative impact on productivity when shifting back and forth between tasks. Studies have shown that this kind of rapid task switching can harm productivity. However, it can also have a positive effect on creativity. When a person is stuck on a task, switching to a different task can decrease cognitive fixation, thereby increasing creativity.\n\n"}

Divergent thinking (DT) is defined as the ability to come up with many different solutions to a prompt, whereas convergent thinking (CT) is defined as the ability to find the single best (correct) solution to a defined question (Cropley, 2006; Guilford, 1956). Although Guilford drew attention to and acknowledged the importance of both processes, creativity quickly became equated with DT, leading to the majority of assessment instruments focusing on measuring DT (Cropley, 2006). These instruments often operationalize DT following Guilford\u2019s (Guilford, 1973) proposal, in terms of ideational fluency (the number of outputs: ideas, products, solutions), flexibility (how different the proposed outputs are from each other), originality (how unique an output is), and elaboration (the level of details in an output).\n### Input: What are the differences between divergent and convergent thinking in the creative process, and how are these concepts typically measured in psychometric creativity assessment instruments?\n### Response: Divergent thinking (DT) and convergent thinking (CT) are two essential processes of creative thinking. DT is defined as the ability to come up with many different solutions to a prompt, while CT is the ability to find the single best (correct) solution to a defined question. In psychometric creativity assessment instruments, these concepts are typically measured in different ways. DT is often operationalized in terms of ideational fluency (the number of outputs: ideas, products, solutions), flexibility (how different the proposed outputs are from each other), originality (how unique an output is), and elaboration (the level of details in an output). CT, on the other hand, is typically measured by the ability to find the single best solution to a defined question.\n\n"}

While we believe that synthesising insights from multiple disciplines about open - ness and collaboration is a valuable first step in designing and managing efficient and  effective processes for producing and disseminating scientific knowledge today, much  remains to be done. By mapping the existing literature and offering a clear conceptua - lisation of the OIS research field, we hope to stimulate fruitful discussions, debates, and  scientific efforts to tackle the gaps we have identified. Unleashing the power of open and  collaborative practices may allow us to produce more novel and impactful scientific  knowledge for the world, to meet the challenges of our time and, in doing so, to better  serve the purposes of science. \n### Input: What is the concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) and how can it advance our understanding of the processes involved in generating and disseminating new scientific insights?\n### Response: The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) is proposed as a unifying foundation that can advance our understanding of the processes involved in generating and disseminating new scientific insights. It focuses on the application of open and collaborative practices throughout the entire process of creating and sharing new scientific knowledge and translating them into innovation. This concept can help us understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences related to these practices. By synthesizing insights from various disciplines about openness and collaboration, OIS can help design and manage efficient and effective processes for producing and disseminating scientific knowledge. It also aims to stimulate discussions and scientific efforts to address identified gaps, with the ultimate goal of producing more novel and impactful scientific knowledge to meet the challenges of our time.\n\n"}

Similarly to Tier 2, the OnSA contains a fixed AI model which assists the participants in solving the task; however, the AI model is trained on the participant data acquired earlier on the very same platform (arrow f). The information flow through the OffSA therefore forms a closed loop as the re-trained\/updated AI model is fed back to the OnSA (arrow g). While the AI does not learn in real time while the individual participants interact with the OnSA it can learn over weeks or months at the collective level, as the model is periodically updated with batches of new data from multiple participants. On an abstract level, the crowd plays the role of the \u201chuman agent\u201d, since the AI is learning from the crowd and the crowd experiences that the AI improves over time. Individuals from the crowd might experience learning of the AI as well if they stay engaged on the CS platform for multiple training cycles. To our knowledge, the only project adopting HI of this type is iNaturalist (iNaturalist, 2021), where participants can use an AI model to classify their images and the model is periodically updated with human-labeled data from the platform. Such an implementation is also underway in the Stall Catchers project and is described in the outlook. 18\n### Input: What is the role of the crowd in Tier 3 Hybrid Intelligence at the collective level in a Citizen Science system?\n### Response: In Tier 3 Hybrid Intelligence at the collective level in a Citizen Science system, the crowd plays the role of the \"human agent\".

Given the immense expressive space of GANs, the range of interpretation of resulting images is expected. Consequently, we did not expect that every user would be able to generate images that evoke a common interpretation, but that many would. The significant overrepresentation of unanimous ratings in our pool of images is an early indication that this is in fact the case. The small number of raters, and consequent small number of ratings per image, limit conclusions about the status of individual images or systematic rater heterogeneity. Our raters were WEIRD, and must be assumed to share cultural references, color and motif preferences, etc. Future work with a larger number.\n### Input: What are the potential limitations of the current study on human-GAN interactions and what areas could be explored in future research?\n### Response: The potential limitations of the current study on human-GAN interactions include a small number of raters and a consequent small number of ratings per image, which limit conclusions about the status of individual images or systematic rater heterogeneity. The raters were also WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), and thus likely to share cultural references, color and motif preferences, etc. Future research could explore work with a larger and more diverse number of raters to address these limitations.\n\n"}

Outreach Design for QST As compared to formal education, outreach activities have a distinct advantage in not being limited to any formal curriculum. As a result, particularly in emerging \ufb01elds such as QST, a focus on activities which are deeply engaging, such as gami\ufb01ed and creative experiences, can offer novel approaches and overcome some of the challenges educators are faced with in teaching quantum concepts with traditional means of instruction. To implement the culturo-scienti\ufb01c narrative should not necessarily require the production of new tools, as many exist already which can support these activities. Instead, we can classify and validate (in future work) the efforts of the community in developing activities which may support the approach, a comprehensive review of which can be found in reference [ 78]. These tools may enhance the experience of participants, particularly within the time limitations available in outreach activities [ 61]. \n### Input: What are the advantages of using outreach activities in teaching emerging fields such as Quantum Science and Technology (QST) over traditional means of instruction?\n### Response: Outreach activities have the advantage of not being limited to any formal curriculum, unlike traditional means of instruction. This allows for a focus on deeply engaging activities, such as gamified and creative experiences, which can offer novel approaches to teaching. These methods can overcome some of the challenges educators face when teaching quantum concepts with traditional means of instruction. Furthermore, outreach activities can utilize existing tools to enhance the experience of participants, particularly within the time limitations available in such activities.\n\n"}

Rafner et al. \/ Human Computation (2022) 9:1    83      We conclude our article by offering five exciting research questions linking the fields of CitSci and AI:  i. Can the skill requirements of ongoing CitSci projects be interpreted as a continually updated \u2018thermometer\u2019 of the boundary between human and AI capabilities? ii. What are the links between the accessibility of concrete CitSci tasks and the particular cognitive processes required to complete them? iii. What are pathways, frameworks and quantification methods for participants to be upskilled during citizen science tasks through AI? iv. How can the explicit task formulations in CitSci lead to increased understanding of human-AI interaction beyond the CitSci field? v. Can the explicitation of the vast amount of CS-tasks that are at present not automatable yield greater appreciation for CitSci as a field and be used to increase participant motivation and sense of achievement?\n### Input: How can the integration of AI in CitSci projects contribute to the upskilling of participants and enhance their motivation and sense of achievement?\n### Response: The integration of AI in CitSci projects can contribute to the upskilling of participants by providing pathways, frameworks, and quantification methods. This could potentially allow participants to learn new skills and improve their existing ones during the process of completing citizen science tasks. Furthermore, the explicitation of the vast amount of CS-tasks that are currently not automatable could lead to a greater appreciation for CitSci as a field. This could be used to increase participant motivation and sense of achievement, as they would be contributing to tasks that cannot be completed by AI, highlighting the unique and valuable capabilities of human intelligence.\n\n"}

Introduction Companies are currently investing enormous resources into AI solutions, motivated by the potential benefits ranging from greater efficiency, faster and more accurate results to more effective and improved strategic outcomes at the organizational level. However, up to 70% of AI projects generate little impact, leaving the majority of AI initiatives a failure [1]. This failure is often attributed to the brittleness of deep learning systems [2] and consequently human-centered AI (HCAI) systems currently rise to prominence by considering AI as a tool for human augmentation and pursuing high levels of automation and user control simultaneously [3]. \n### Input: What are the potential benefits of investing in AI solutions and why do human-centered AI systems rise to prominence despite the high failure rate of AI projects?\n### Response: The potential benefits of investing in AI solutions include greater efficiency, faster and more accurate results, and more effective and improved strategic outcomes at the organizational level. Despite the high failure rate of AI projects, human-centered AI systems rise to prominence because they consider AI as a tool for human augmentation and pursue high levels of automation and user control simultaneously. This approach aims to overcome the brittleness of deep learning systems, which is often attributed to the failure of AI projects.\n\n"}

While large  teams have benefits in terms of labour inputs, knowledge diversity, and division of labour  (Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007 ), they may struggle with becoming too unwieldy to enable  effective exchange and engagement (Mote et al. 2016 ). Others have concluded that large  teams tend to develop science and technology incrementally, while small teams tend to be  more disruptive (Wu, Wang, and Evans 2019 ). One contingency that may moderate size  effects is the team\u2019s integrative and absorptive capacity, which has been shown to be  crucial for knowledge integration (Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson 2013 ; Salazar  et al. 2012 ).\n### Input: What role does a team's integrative and absorptive capacity play in moderating the effects of team size on knowledge integration and overall effectiveness?\n### Response: The text suggests that a team's integrative and absorptive capacity may moderate the effects of team size on knowledge integration and overall effectiveness.

Calls  from these major public institutions triggered an immi - nent need for large-scale assessments and training of these  skills, both in corporate and educational sectors. As  a student, worker or work-seeker, employer, or govern - mental agency, the assessment of one\u2019s own skill or those  of others is paramount for upward mobility and appro - priate job placement (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021 ; Stuart, 2009 ; Zojceska, 2019 ). Thus, ensuring the accessibility of  assessment mechanisms, such as through freely available  online platforms, for creativity and other 21st century  skills, becomes crucial for an equitable society. That  being said, it can be futile or even harmful to scale-up  and provide easy access to invalid or unreliable assess - ment instruments as is the case with the burgeoning  number of apps that promise to evaluate creativity yet  lack a solid theoretical foundation. \n### Input: What is the importance of valid and reliable assessment mechanisms for creativity and other 21st century skills in ensuring an equitable society?\n### Response: The text suggests that valid and reliable assessment mechanisms for creativity and other 21st century skills are important in ensuring an equitable society because they are paramount for upward mobility and appropriate job placement. These assessments allow individuals, whether they are students, workers, employers, or governmental agencies, to understand their own skills or those of others. This understanding can then be used to ensure that individuals are placed in roles that suit their skills, promoting fairness and equality. Furthermore, the accessibility of these assessment mechanisms, such as through freely available online platforms, is crucial in ensuring that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, has the opportunity to assess and improve their skills. However, the text warns that it can be harmful to scale-up and provide easy access to invalid or unreliable assessment instruments, as they may provide inaccurate results and lead to inappropriate job placements or missed opportunities for skill development.\n\n"}

We embed our approach to outreach in culturo-scienti\ufb01c thinking . This is constituted by embracing disciplinary thinking (in particular creativity) whilst appreciating the epistemology of science as an evolving dialogue of ideas, with numerous alternative perspectives and uncertain futures to be managed. Structuring scienti\ufb01c knowledge as an assemblage of interacting and evolving discipline- cultures, we conceive of a culturo-scienti\ufb01c storytelling to bring about positive transformations for the public in these thinking skills and ground our approach in quantum science and technologies (QST). This \ufb01eld has the potential to generate signi\ufb01cant changes for the life of every citizen, and so a skills-oriented approach to its education, both formal and non-formal, is essential. Finally, we present examples of such storytelling in the case of QST, the classi\ufb01cation and evaluation of which correspond to future work in which this narrative approach is studied in action.\n### Input: What is the role of outreach in developing the modern scientific mind and why is it considered essential in the society of rapid technological development?\n### Response: The role of outreach in developing the modern scientific mind is to facilitate the understanding and appreciation of science as an evolving dialogue of ideas, with numerous alternative perspectives and uncertain futures to be managed.

Despite the growth, however, many citizen science  projects struggle to achieve the goal of collecting sufficient data for robust scientific research.  Stated plainly, a core challenge is to generate data of sufficient quantity and quality. With  increasing levels of digitalization in citizen science projects\u2014chiefly, gamified science  tasks\u2014[2], participant contributions can be tracked and quantified. The quantity of contribution per  participant in such volunteer based projects tends to have a long-tailed distribution, in which a large  group of participants contribute leisurely and a small core of participants contribute significantly  more [3\u20136]. This difference may in part be attributable to varying levels of expertise, either with  playing video games in general, with the core scientific content, or both [7, 8] however is not at  the moment understood in detail. The probability of disengaging is in commercial applications  often referred to as the \u201cchurn rate\u201d [9, 10]. Figure 1 demonstrates the churn rate of Quantum  Moves 2 [11], a citizen science game analyzed within this work.\n### Input: What is the core challenge in generating data for citizen science projects and how does the concept of \"churn rate\" relate to this issue?\n### Response: The core challenge in generating data for citizen science projects is to produce data of sufficient quantity and quality. The concept of \"churn rate\" relates to this issue as it refers to the probability of participants disengaging from the project. This disengagement can lead to a decrease in the quantity of data collected, as fewer participants are contributing to the project. Furthermore, if the participants who disengage are those with higher levels of expertise, this could also impact the quality of the data collected.\n\n"}

Discussion: The Culturo-Scientific Narrative in QST Given the significance of the choice of storyt elling for QST, the inherent impact of the narrative follows, as the resulting technologies will have such an enormous impact on society [94]. Their engineering opens the way to simulate pharmacological interactions and create customised therapies [95], or to prod uce more efficient fertilisers that are less polluting than is currently possible [96]. Mate rials will be developed capable of capturing and transforming carbon dioxide emissions [97]. Numerous other transformations will come in the fields of telecommunications, artificial intelligence, and information sciences [15]. These technologies stem from different scie nces, such as physics, biology, medicine, computer science, and engineering. They will have profound implications felt beyond tra-ditional boundaries, in fields such as economic s [98], judicial sciences [99], and philosophy [100]. Their effect on our everyday life can be predicted to be significant, from the manner in which we manage our health and educatio n, to how we communicate and store infor- mation [15]. Although the expansion of QST is clearly calling for a quantum-aware popu-lation, we can predict that the increasing interdisciplinarity will also need to be reflected throughout education and research. We might ask whether we should (in future work) conceive of interdisciplinary-culturo storytelling, reflective of the ever-tighter and more im- portant interaction of the scientific DCs, in creasingly driving technological innovations [101]. \n### Input: What implications might the expansion and increasing interdisciplinarity of Quantum Science and Technology (QST) have on education and research, and how might this influence the concept of interdisciplinary-culturo storytelling?\n### Response: The expansion and increasing interdisciplinarity of Quantum Science and Technology (QST) might have profound implications on education and research. As QST technologies stem from different sciences such as physics, biology, medicine, computer science, and engineering, they will have impacts felt beyond traditional boundaries, in fields such as economics, judicial sciences, and philosophy. This suggests that education and research will need to reflect this increasing interdisciplinarity, possibly requiring a more integrated approach to teaching and studying these diverse fields. \n\nIn terms of interdisciplinary-culturo storytelling, the increasing interdisciplinarity of QST might influence this concept by making it more reflective of the ever-tighter and more important interaction of the scientific Disciplinary Communities (DCs). As these DCs increasingly drive technological innovations, the stories told about these innovations and their impacts might need to incorporate perspectives from multiple disciplines, reflecting the complex, interconnected nature of the work being done in QST. This could lead to a more holistic, nuanced understanding of these technologies and their societal impacts.\n\n"}

It has been argued that entrepreneurial intention should be negatively correlated with cognitive abilities due to the opportunity costs of alternative employment options45,46; that is, people with high cognitive abilities are more likely to have good employment opportunities. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis (r = -0.09, p = 0.01, n = 720), with all individual abilities showing a negative correlation with entrepreneurial intention, and most correlations being significant. Surprisingly, contrary to the Jack-of-all-Trades theory45\u201347, which predicts that generalists (who have a uniform distribution of abilities) have a better fit with an entrepreneurial career, we found that people with greater variation in cognitive abilities had higher entrepreneurial intention (r = 0.09, p = 0.01, n = 720). Prior tentative confirmations of the Jack-of-all-Trades theory have Fig 4: Cognitive abilities across age groups. 6,312 wild players played the games; fewer played the combination of tasks that allowed for assessment of a specific ability. The shaded areas around the curves are the standard error of the mean.

This means that people with higher cognitive abilities are less likely to have an interest in starting their own business. The correlation was confirmed with a value of r = -0.09, p = 0.01, n = 720. However, it was also found that people with greater variation in cognitive abilities had higher entrepreneurial intention.\n\n"}

Between December 2020 and March 2021 there were 580 user sessions, producing 8475 images of which 1624 were saved to the utopian\/dystopian galleries and 196 downloaded by users. To test whether created images were recognizable as a utopia or a dystopia we collected classification judgments. We ex- amined the degree of agreement between raters and the degree of agreement with the original creator\u2019s label. This is critical as appro- priateness as well as novelty [ 40] are key components of creativity and thus the generated images must be at a minimum recogniz- able as appropriate to the prompt. We also asked raters to give an indication for each image of which aspects were most important in characterizing it as utopian or dystopian. A total of 24 raters were recruited, but only data from eight raters who rated more than 100 images was considered for analysis. Rater agreement statistics were calculated only for the three raters who rated all images. All included raters self-reported normal vision. Raters were familiar with the project, but had not seen these images before, and were blind to each other\u2019s ratings and to the label given by the original user. Raters were presented with one image at a time via a web app that prompted them to label each image as \u2018utopia\u2019 or \u2018dystopia\u2019 - described in the instructions as \u201ca future paradise where society is doing great\u201d and \u201ca nightmarish future where society has gone horribly wrong\u201d respectively. Raters were asked to \u201cpick the cat- egory the image is most similar to, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good example\u201d.

P4 immediately turns up all three sliders, one of them by 0.24 and the other two by about 0.4, and generates an image that looks like a bird. P4 then says, Okay.

While previous research has established the suitability of various multimodal research methods for use with persons with intellectual disabilities (e.g., Povee et al. 2014), this study employs participatory mapping to explore the capabilities afforded and denied to institutionalized individuals with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families. Defined as \u201ca process in which community members, writ large, contribute their own experiences, relationships, information, and ideas about a place to the creation of a map\u201d (Cochrane & Corbett 2020: 706), the technique of participatory mapping is especially relevant to our research context because it stands to shed light on spatial dynamics of access\/exclusion and empowerment\/ deprivation that arise in the context of detainment. Used previously to draw out the perspectives of people with intellectual disabilities (e.g., Robinson et al. 2020), the technique is extended here to elicit and compare maps created by a range of stakeholders, including human rights advocates and representatives of detention facilities. In consultation with a stakeholder advisory group, the research team will define an orienting set of locations and themes for each research participant to explore in the map that the participant creates: one place to start would be inside vs. outside the facility (including relevant community institutions), along with barriers encountered or expected and the feelings or sense memories associated with them. Each participant will be given standard instructions and supplied with drawing materials, as well as access to communication partners as needed. Then, either in a synchronous workshop setting or an asynchronous digital format, participants will be invited to engage with each others\u2019 maps, responding to the representations of others through communication channels including but not limited to language (e.g., drawn annotation). The shared or divergent understandings that surface can then be triangulated with other research data to identify areas for service improvement or more robust oversight.\n### Input: What insights can be gained from using participatory mapping as a research method to explore the experiences and perspectives of institutionalized individuals with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families?\n### Response: Participatory mapping as a research method can provide insights into the spatial dynamics of access\/exclusion and empowerment\/deprivation that arise in the context of detainment. It can help to understand the perspectives of institutionalized individuals with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families, as well as other stakeholders such as human rights advocates and representatives of detention facilities. The method can shed light on the barriers encountered or expected by these individuals and the feelings or sense memories associated with them. It can also help to identify areas for service improvement or more robust oversight by comparing and contrasting the maps created by different stakeholders. Furthermore, it can facilitate engagement and communication among participants, allowing for shared or divergent understandings to surface.\n\n"}

While OIS may influence the science system and its stakeholders in a number of ways, here we highlight impacts associated with increased novelty, reliability, and efficiency in scientific practices. Research has shown that novel combinations of knowledge from diverse sets of actors can lead to more impactful ideas (Uzzi et al. 2013 ). Thus, one type of impact related to the application of open and collaborative practices in science is catalysing novelty. As we have seen, boundary-crossing inputs at the early stages of the research process can help to identify new and relevant scientific problems (Beck et al. 2020 ; Sauermann et al. 2020 ). Breakthroughs during the exploration and testing phases of scientific research have been linked to the application of OIS practices in a variety of scientific fields, including heliophysics (Lifshitz-Assaf 2018 ), radiation therapy (Mak et al. 2019 ), and bioinformatics (Blasco et al. 2019 ). Open and collaborative dissemination practices have also been tied to increased novelty, as with the uptake of scientific knowledge from sources like Wikipedia into original research agendas (Thompson and Hanley 2018 ).\n### Input: How does the application of open and collaborative practices in science catalyse novelty and increase reliability and efficiency in scientific practices?\n### Response: The application of open and collaborative practices in science catalyses novelty by encouraging the combination of knowledge from diverse sets of actors, leading to more impactful ideas. These practices also facilitate boundary-crossing inputs at the early stages of the research process, helping to identify new and relevant scientific problems. Breakthroughs during the exploration and testing phases of scientific research have been linked to the application of these practices in various scientific fields. Open and collaborative dissemination practices have also been tied to increased novelty, as they allow for the uptake of scientific knowledge from sources like Wikipedia into original research agendas. This not only increases the novelty of the research but also its reliability and efficiency, as it allows for a wider range of inputs and perspectives.\n\n"}

Such analyses increasingly begin not from essentialist assumptions  about national character, but from a political economy perspective that emphasises  power and contingency (Tyfield et al. 2017 ). For example, the centrality of non-  commercial open access publishing in Latin America can be explained, in part, by the  historical lack of market penetration by commercial publishers in the region (Becerril-  Garc\u00eda et al. 2019 ). One contemporary issue that has gained widespread attention is that  of public trust in science, although its relationship to openness and collaboration is  a complex one. While the latter are often presented as remedies for a crisis of trust in  science, low trust can also deter social actors from participating in the very forms of  public engagement that are meant to enlist their support (e.g. Dawson 2018 ). This effect  may be further compounded by what social scientists have framed as the active and  strategic production of ignorance (Proctor and Schiebinger 2008 ).\n### Input: How does the historical lack of market penetration by commercial publishers in Latin America contribute to the centrality of non-commercial open access publishing in the region?\n### Response: The text suggests that the historical lack of market penetration by commercial publishers in Latin America has contributed to the centrality of non-commercial open access publishing in the region. However, it does not provide specific details on how this has occurred.\n\n"}

However, they are criticized for the following reasons: \u25cfThey are often administered in strict testing conditions and in artificial contexts (e.g., in laboratories) to ensure internal validity.4 These are however far removed from natural situations, where one would express their creativity (Cotter & Silvia, 2019 ) and can induce unintended physiological effects such as test anxiety (Schram & Ule, 2019 ) and Hawthorne effect (McCambridge, Witton, & Elbourne, 2014 ). \u25cfThey are not particularly meaningful to the participants (Valladares-Rodr\u00edguez, P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez, Anido-Rif\u00f3n, & Fern\u00e1ndez-Iglesias, 2016 ). \u25cfThey rely on fairly simple interactions and only analyze the final product, which does not afford the ability to capture detailed, fine grained steps in an individual\u2019s trajectory toward an output (Schulte-Mecklenbeck, K\u00fchberger, & Johnson, 2019 ). \u25cfThey rely on resource-intensive administration and human raters (Cseh & Jeffries, 2019 ). When there are few raters, individual taste, preferences and idiosyncrasies will have an impact. Employing multiple raters and measuring interrater reliability (the extent to which judges agree on the scoring of the answers) is effective but resource-intensive. If raters spend long hours assessing items, they are susceptible to fatigue, compromising the reliability of their judgments (Cseh & Jeffries, 2019 ).\n### Input: What are some of the criticisms of standard creativity tests and how do they potentially impact the validity and reliability of these tests?\n### Response: Standard creativity tests are criticized for several reasons. Firstly, they are often administered in strict testing conditions and artificial contexts, such as laboratories, which are far removed from natural situations where creativity is typically expressed. This can induce unintended physiological effects like test anxiety and the Hawthorne effect, potentially impacting the validity of the tests. Secondly, these tests are not particularly meaningful to the participants, which could affect their engagement and performance. Thirdly, they rely on simple interactions and only analyze the final product, which does not allow for capturing detailed steps in an individual\u2019s creative process, potentially limiting the validity of the tests. Lastly, these tests rely on resource-intensive administration and human raters. The individual tastes, preferences, and idiosyncrasies of a small number of raters can impact the results. While employing multiple raters and measuring interrater reliability can be effective, it is resource-intensive and raters are susceptible to fatigue, which can compromise the reliability of their judgments.\n\n"}

Introduction Citizen Science (CS) attracts hundreds of thousands of participants to research projects that utilize human problem-solving for tasks of varying complexity (Heck et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2018). This collective intelligence of participants has contributed to many scientific discoveries, for example in protein folding (Cooper et al. 2010, Koepnick et al. 2019), galaxy morphology identification (Lintott et al. 2011, Masters and Galaxy Zoo Team 2019), mapping of neurons in the brain (Kim et al. 2014), heuristics for solving quantum physics challenges (Jensen et al., 2021), tracking changes in biodiversity and ecology (Li et al. 2019, Wang et al. 2018), observing and monitoring air pollution (Snik et al. 2014), and transcribing manuscript collections (Causer and Terras 2014). Some of these achievements have been made in part by participants going beyond the narrow task given to them, digging further into the data to understand and interpret what they are seeing (Lintott  2019).\n### Input: What are some examples of scientific discoveries that have been contributed to by the collective intelligence of participants in Citizen Science projects?\n### Response: Some examples of scientific discoveries contributed to by the collective intelligence of participants in Citizen Science projects include protein folding, galaxy morphology identification, mapping of neurons in the brain, heuristics for solving quantum physics challenges, tracking changes in biodiversity and ecology, observing and monitoring air pollution, and transcribing manuscript collections.\n\n"}

As  a first naive approach, open-ended data was collected on  research focus and definition of creativity in order to get  a broad sense of the studies. Then granularity was increased  to include the game description, scoring methods used, the  number of participants , whether individual, dyadic , or  group creativity was being assessed, the stated motivations  for using game-based assessments, the method of validat - ing the game, and the level of correlation observed. Some  seemingly straightforward codes such as the number of  participants proved to be problematic. For example, due  to anonymized data, one study reported the number of  game sessions, not the number of players. With regards to  the focus of the study being individual, dyadic or group  creativity, an additional option of co-creative was added,  when a paper describing a game that a child plays together  with a robot was encountered. Following a variation of  Remy, MacDonald Vermeulen, Frich, Biskjaer, and  Dalsgaard (2020 ), codes were systematically divided into  three categories: open ended, numeric, and nominal.\n### Input: What were the three categories into which codes were systematically divided in the coding scheme developed by the coauthors?\n### Response: The three categories into which codes were systematically divided in the coding scheme developed by the coauthors were open ended, numeric, and nominal.\n\n"}

The games presented in this  paper not only span a range of disciplines and experi - mental settings, but also a range of game design decisions,  research approach and data analysis. The review portrays  a clear interest in and potential for digital games to assess  creativity. However, the small number of studies indicates  the infancy of the field. Many of the studies in this review  have been conducted by natural or social science teams,  which allows for speculations that at this nascent stage,  the field is dominated by explorative and domain specific  endeavors rather than displaying the strong interdisci - plinary dialogue between computer and social sciences,  which could be an important step to reach scalability.  Scalability is one element that is crucial both to under - stand creativity and to subsequently assess it. As projects  grow in depth and scale, another challenge emerges: it will  be unfeasible to perform expert consensual assessment of  in-game produced products. Further efforts to algorith - mic assessment of such products as well as explorations 42  J. RAFNER ET AL.\n### Input: What steps can be taken to improve the scalability of creativity assessment in digital games and foster interdisciplinary dialogue between computer and social sciences?\n### Response: The text suggests that further efforts towards algorithmic assessment of in-game produced products could improve the scalability of creativity assessment in digital games. Additionally, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue between computer and social sciences could be an important step towards scalability and understanding creativity.\n\n"}

In the following we move from an assessment of the nature of the task structure to the impact of search behaviors. 2.5. Changing Search Strategies. Typically, an agent is set to primarily engage in one-bit flips when searching the landscape, although other kinds of distant search strategies such as random search or searches that match the underlying landscape have also been implemented [15, 26, 29]. We do not intend to discuss which search strategies should be applied in any given context but want to highlight that the chosen search strategies (e.g., two-bit flips rather than a one-bit flip) not only reflect an assumption about search behavior but also constitute variations in distance metrics that influence the shape of the fitness landscape itself. In other words, the same fitness function can thus lead to qualitatively different landscapes, when assuming different kinds of search behavior [62]. To illustrate this point, Figure 2 shows an example of the same function mapped onto three different landscapes using three different assumptions about search behavior. We used a dimensionality reduction method called t-SNE [65], which transforms high-dimensional data to low-dimensional representations while approximately preserving pairwise similarities and global structure to create 3D visualizations of the multidimensional landscape. This visual transformation allows for a useful representation of relevant features of a landscape, such as how the connectedness of a landscape depends on search behavior assumptions. Given the fact that the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm is stochastic, as is the NK fitness function, it should be noted that this is one possible illustration of one possible NK landscape with N=8 and K=3. The illustration is not a general result for all NK landscapes of N=8 and K=3 and should be considered a visualization of a conceptual argument. The visualization is informative in two ways. First, when assessing the visualization, it is clear that the two-bit-flip search strategies (Figure 2(b)) generate qualitatively different landscapes. Depending on the starting point, a subset of solutions is not connected in the graph. Similarly, if one attempts to traverse a sequence of consecutive numbers with increments of two, one generates two distinct and Complexity 5.\n### Input: What is the impact of different search strategies on the shape of the fitness landscape in an adaptive solver?\n### Response: The chosen search strategies, such as two-bit flips rather than a one-bit flip, not only reflect an assumption about search behavior but also constitute variations in distance metrics that influence the shape of the fitness landscape itself.

Pen and paper standardized process-oriented assessments: These assess creative processes through individual or batteries of tests targeting components of divergent thinking (DT) or convergent thinking (CT). They have a large corpus of research, decades of practical use, and are often easy to manually administer. However, they are resource-intensive, potentially unmotivating, capture only final products, and may induce unintended psychological effects.\n\n2. Digital standardized process-oriented assessments: These also assess creative processes through individual or batteries of tasks targeting components of DT or CT. They are scalable if automated assessment is possible. However, they are new and not widely studied yet, potentially unmotivating, resource-intensive when human raters are employed, and may induce unintended psychological effects.\n\n3. Product-oriented assessment: This assesses the creativity of a product by individual and independent consensus of expert raters. It has a large corpus of research, decades of practical use, and clearly indicates ability to produce creative products. However, it is resource-intensive and therefore often not easily scalable.\n\n4. Person and environmental focused assessment: This includes assessment of creative behavior, creative self-perception. It has a large corpus of research, decades of practical use. However, it has an increased risk of confounding variables given the broad scope, bias due to self-reporting, and is resource-intensive and therefore often not easily scalable.\n\n5. Commercial game-based assessments: These can be forms of digitized psychometric and non-psychometric tests, or other unspecified mechanisms. They are designed to be used at scale and have engaging interaction design. However, they have little (if any) scientific backing or disclosure of methodology, and costs limit equitable access.\n\n6. Digital game employing stealth assessment: Evidence needed to assess the creative process is provided by the players\u2019 interactions with the game itself.

The boundaries of discipline-based research are blurring, with important research questions lying at the intersection of traditional disciplines (Nowotny, Scott, and Gibbons 2006 ). Interdisciplinary research has been defined as \u2018a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and\/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialised knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice\u2019 (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine 2005 , 2). The degree of knowledge integration from source disciplines varies from borrowing and contrasting to integrating and transcending existing bodies of knowledge (Miller 1982 ). Rafols and Meyer (2010 ) thus prefer to describe interdisciplinarity in terms of diversity and coherence, highlighting the breadth and novelty of knowledge integration. It can be difficult to establish when interdisciplinarity takes place, as cognitive overlaps make boundaries between and within disciplines difficult to identify. Thus, a more fine-grained classification for levels of interaction, for example from weak to full, may be suitable (Huutoniemi et al. 2010 ). \n### Input: What are the challenges in establishing when interdisciplinary research takes place and how can a more fine-grained classification for levels of interaction address these challenges?\n### Response: The text suggests that the challenges in establishing when interdisciplinary research takes place lie in the cognitive overlaps that make boundaries between and within disciplines difficult to identify. A more fine-grained classification for levels of interaction, ranging from weak to full, could address these challenges by providing a more nuanced understanding of the degree of interdisciplinarity. This could help to distinguish between different degrees of knowledge integration from source disciplines, from borrowing and contrasting to integrating and transcending existing bodies of knowledge.\n\n"}

Howe ver, this is not the complete picture. Ein- stein was aware that scientific concepts are \u201cfree creations of the human mind\u201d [50], open interpretations of nature which are not unique. It is clear within the DC framework, where alternative interpretations are not discarded or  incorrect, but are simply lying in the pe- riphery, no less valid than those accepted pa radigms in the nucleus and working theories in the body. What may be considered objective scientific discoveries fundamentally rely on theories which are themselves creations [51]. Creativity, then, is an essential compo-nent of the scientific process. It can be observed within the method of inquiry (through theory-building) [35,52], and is a routine skill of the working scientist in experimental de-sign, problem-solving, hypothesis forming, and modelling [51,52].\n### Input: What role does creativity play in the scientific process according to the DC framework?\n### Response: According to the DC framework, creativity is an essential component of the scientific process. It is observed within the method of inquiry, particularly in theory-building. It is also a routine skill of the working scientist in areas such as experimental design, problem-solving, hypothesis forming, and modelling. The framework also suggests that scientific concepts, which are creations of the human mind, can have alternative interpretations that are not discarded or considered incorrect, but are simply lying in the periphery, no less valid than the accepted paradigms and working theories.\n\n"}

How \u201cmuch\u201d each image should contribute to the resulting picture is up to the player: each image\u2019s weight can be adjusted using a slider next to each image. blender uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ 14] which is the most widely used type of ML models for image generation [ 15,16]. Before studying if blender can be used as a creativity assessment tool, I first had to determine that players could express control over the interface and the algorithm [ 1]. Inblender , players first complete a tutorial which introduces them to the basic game mechanics and features. They then proceed through the three modes. In the DT mode players are presented with five images and are asked to create and save as many different \"animal-like\" creatures as possible in four minutes (Fig 2, left) and save at least three images. After completing the tasks, players are asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale how similar two images are. In the CT mode players are presented with a target image and three sets of three source images. Only one set can produce the exact target image, and players\u2019 objective is first to determine which set was used to create the target image (up to 30 seconds) (Fig 2, right), and then to recreate their closest approximation of the target image (up to three min). There are three levels in this mode. The pilot study [ 1] revealed that it can be very frustrating for players if they have selected the incorrect set and are forced to spend three minutes attempting to create an unattainable solution. Therefore, participants are allowed to end the question early by clicking \u201cI think I choose the wrong set. \u201d Additionally, there is now a threshold for how close participants should get to the target image values for it to be considered a match to prevent participants from spending excess time fine tuning their images. In free play\n### Input: What is the purpose of the DT mode in the game Inblender?\n### Response: The purpose of the DT mode in the game Inblender is for players to create and save as many different \"animal-like\" creatures as possible in four minutes. They are presented with five images and are required to save at least three images.\n\n"}

A special case of interdisciplinary collaboration are large-scale research infrastructures that provide scientists access to highly specialised instrumentation and experimental conditions beyond the reach of most research organisations. Experiments at such facilities require collaboration between permanent scientists and external users (Hallonsten 2016 ). This can range from short-lived interactions to highly complementary collaborations in which local instrument scientists and visiting scientist-users bring together needed expertise and skills (D\u2019Ippolito and R\u00fcling 2019 ). In this context, a culture of openness can emerge, with norms governing the allocation of credit for the resulting output. Long-term collaborations also help to advance the development of instruments themselves (Tuertscher, Garud, and Kumaraswamy 2014 ), facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration between actors who might not otherwise collaborate (Kaplan, Milde, and Cowan 2017 ). Prominent examples of large-scale or \u2018big science\u2019 collaborations include the Manhattan Project, the Human Genome Project, and the Large Hadron Collider experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). Such a shared infrastructure can facilitate or even necessitate the application of OIS practices. \n### Input: What are some examples of large-scale or 'big science' collaborations that necessitate the application of Open Innovation Science practices?\n### Response: The examples of large-scale or 'big science' collaborations that necessitate the application of Open Innovation Science practices include the Manhattan Project, the Human Genome Project, and the Large Hadron Collider experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN).\n\n"}

The full version was introduced in a 2nd year university introductory quantum mechanics course[22], as well as in this 4th year course with more emphasis on time dependent dynamics. It allowed students to experiment with specifying potentials and examining eigenstate mixtures in the context of the time independent and dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The time evolution of the designed wave function could be performed in an auxiliary potential. This helps students visualize that the time evolution in a static potential can be explained by a phase evolution of the eigenstates. In addition, it presented an opportunity to bring together otherwise unrelated features of the core curriculum (parity selection rules and time dependent perturbation theory) to achieve a detailed understanding of the core research challenge of the Quantum Moves games\u2014 to remove kinetic energy from an oscillating cloud.\n### Input: What benefits does the quantum mechanics simulation tool provide to students in understanding the time evolution of wave functions and the core research challenge of the Quantum Moves games?\n### Response: The quantum mechanics simulation tool allows students to experiment with specifying potentials and examining eigenstate mixtures in the context of the time independent and dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

This increased ruggedness makes it more difficult for the agent to search in the landscape. This is because the landscape's complexity and the number of local peaks increase with the K\/N ratio, making it harder to find the global optimum.\n\n"}

More generally, crowd science involves  \u2018scientific research done in an open and collaborative fashion\u2019 (Franzoni and  Sauermann 2014 , 1). Some studies have categorised citizen and crowd science projects  based on the degree of participant involvement (Shirk et al. 2012 ; Wiggins and Crowston  2011 ). Most of these frameworks place a co-created approach as the highest level,  emphasising the democratisation of science by bridging the gap between academia and  the public (Bonney et al. 2009 ).\n### Input: What is the highest level of participant involvement in citizen and crowd science projects, according to most frameworks?\n### Response: According to most frameworks, the highest level of participant involvement in citizen and crowd science projects is a co-created approach.\n\n"}

Indeed, in the case of hierarchical interdependence, complementary can be responsible for this. WZ_heH-XOR function is an interesting illustration of this mechanism: when subcomponents can be optimized independently or quasi-independently, this creates a landscape that can be characterized by deception, since there are multiple optimal ways of combining the lower level building blocks, but awareness of the highest hierarchical level is required for finding the global optimum. As argued earlier, we believe this hierarchical interdependence to be an essential feature for organizations [50], and therefore some level of deceptiveness is unavoidable. In essence, such insights would allow us to make more sophisticated decisions about what kind of theoretical modeling assumptions to rely on and in which situations.\n### Input: What is the role of hierarchical interdependence in creating a deceptive landscape in the WZ_heH-XOR function, and how does this relate to decision-making in organizations?\n### Response: Hierarchical interdependence in the WZ_heH-XOR function creates a deceptive landscape by allowing subcomponents to be optimized independently or quasi-independently. This results in multiple optimal ways of combining the lower level building blocks, but the global optimum can only be found with awareness of the highest hierarchical level. This is related to decision-making in organizations because, as the text argues, hierarchical interdependence is an essential feature for organizations. Therefore, some level of deceptiveness is unavoidable. Understanding this can help make more sophisticated decisions about what kind of theoretical modeling assumptions to rely on in different situations.\n\n"}

As illustrated, there may be projects exhibiting a mixture of features from two categories. Another boundary case is CitSci remote optimization of concrete experiments (Heck et al., 2018), which would clearly be amenable to RL treatment but requires execution of a real-world experiment in order to evaluate the quality of any given user-specified candidate solution and therefore does not have a self-contained model. Another example is the CitSci game EteRNA where participants create RNA designs which can be partially evaluated within the software but must then be synthesized through a remote wet laboratory experimental pipeline to assess design candidates (Lee et al., 2014). \n### Input: What is a common feature between the CitSci remote optimization of concrete experiments and the CitSci game EteRNA, in terms of evaluating the quality of user-specified candidate solutions?\n### Response: Both the CitSci remote optimization of concrete experiments and the CitSci game EteRNA require real-world experiments to evaluate the quality of user-specified candidate solutions. In the case of CitSci remote optimization, it requires the execution of a real-world experiment, while EteRNA requires the synthesis of RNA designs through a remote wet laboratory experimental pipeline to assess design candidates.\n\n"}

Here, too, the  case of research data is instructive, as expectations for accessibility are now widely cast in  terms of the dictum \u2018as open as possible and as closed as necessary\u2019. Permissible reasons  for not sharing data have been taken to include privacy concerns reflected in regulations  like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), security considerations, and pro- tection for commercial or industrial exploitation. Issues of social justice also demand to  be considered as boundary conditions, as with the growing movement for indigenous  data sovereignty (Kukutai and Taylor 2016 ). In these cases, research suggests that  mediated revelation to selected actors via trusted intermediary organisations can help  to mitigate the risks of complete openness (e.g. Perkmann and Schildt 2015 ).\n### Input: What are some valid reasons for limiting openness and collaboration in the application of Open Innovation Systems (OIS) practices, particularly in the context of research data?\n### Response: The text mentions several valid reasons for limiting openness and collaboration in the application of Open Innovation Systems (OIS) practices, particularly in the context of research data. These include privacy concerns, which are reflected in regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), security considerations, and protection for commercial or industrial exploitation. Social justice issues, such as the movement for indigenous data sovereignty, are also considered valid reasons for not sharing data.\n\n"}

We have primarily collected data within the Danish population, but Skill Lab is ready for follow-up studies in other countries as it is available in Danish, English, and Spanish. It approaches the population-scale assessment usually limited to registry, commercial, and meta-studies, thereby providing a unique tool.\n### Input: What makes the Skill Lab's population-scale assessment exemplary compared to other game-based studies?\n### Response: The Skill Lab's population-scale assessment is exemplary compared to other game-based studies due to its combination of large sample size and the breadth of cognitive abilities measured. It has been applied to 6,312 players, a significant number relative to other studies. Additionally, it is not limited to a specific population as it is available in Danish, English, and Spanish, making it ready for follow-up studies in other countries.\n\n"}

A phenomenon is observed which is responsible for engaging students\u2019 curiosity. It may conflict with their internal working model of nature, puzzling them and offering a challenge to be met. In previous models based on the DC framework, such phenomena have been alternate theories and view-points which are generally considered historical in nature [62,63]. However, in rapidly developing fields such as Quantum Technolo gies, unexplainable phenomena can equally be future-oriented. In either case, participants are faced with the evolving nature of their field, allowing activities to support epistemological advancement.\n### Input: What role do unexplainable phenomena play in engaging students' curiosity and supporting epistemological advancement in rapidly developing fields such as Quantum Technologies?\n### Response: Unexplainable phenomena in rapidly developing fields like Quantum Technologies can engage students' curiosity by conflicting with their existing understanding of nature, thus presenting a challenge. These phenomena, which can be future-oriented, expose students to the evolving nature of their field. This can support epistemological advancement by encouraging them to question and expand their knowledge and understanding.\n\n"}

The structure of discipline-culture within the framework of Tseitlin et al. Adapted from [27]. 2.2. Scientific Skills of the Modern Day: Culturo-Scientific Thinking Scientific thinking is commonly understood as knowledge-seeking [35]. Inherent in this definition is a reliance on a \u201cgap\u201d in understanding which needs to be filled. The methodology for filling this gap is commonly known as the inquiry cycle [35]. It consists of observation, experimentation, and theory-bu ilding [36] in a continual process of refine- ment. From a disciplinary perspective, the literacies benefitting this methodology are the formal (mathematical), creative, and experiment al [37]. It is important to note that, as Kuhn puts it: \u201cto seek knowledge is to acknowledge that one\u2019s existing knowledge is in-complete\u201d [35]. In order to truly think like a scientist, one must be searching for new ex-p l a n a t i o n s ,  t h e o r i e s ,  o r  o b s e r v a t i o n s  o f  s o m e  a s p e c t  o f  n a t u r e  t h a t  c a n n o t  b e  f u l l y  e x -plained or described. It is embedded in inquiry as a cyclical process which recognises that there is more to know. Being comfortable and, crucially, self-aware of the limitations of one\u2019s theory, and that scientific knowledg e is incomplete and ever-developing demon- strates advanced epistemological beliefs.\n### Input: What are the key components of the inquiry cycle in scientific thinking and how do they contribute to the development of scientific knowledge?\n### Response: The key components of the inquiry cycle in scientific thinking are observation, experimentation, and theory-building. These components contribute to the development of scientific knowledge by providing a systematic methodology for filling gaps in understanding. Observation allows for the identification of these gaps and the formulation of questions or hypotheses. Experimentation then tests these hypotheses, providing data and results that can either support or refute them. Theory-building, on the other hand, involves the interpretation of these results and the formulation of new theories or modifications to existing ones based on the findings. This process is cyclical and continuous, allowing for constant refinement and development of scientific knowledge. It also acknowledges that scientific knowledge is incomplete and ever-evolving, encouraging a constant search for new explanations, theories, or observations.\n\n"}

Students were able to control whether the magnets were horizontally or vertically oriented. The simulation continued through the lesson to add more sets of magnets and allowed students to choose to block specific spin components after each set of magnets. The challenges in the simulations were either to predict the pattern on the backscreen given a specific configuration of magnets and blockers or to generate a specific pattern on the backscreen by creating a specific configuration. This allowed students to gain an intuition for the system in a puzzle-like activity.\n### Input: What were the challenges in the 3D simulation that helped students gain an intuition for the system?\n### Response: The challenges in the 3D simulation that helped students gain an intuition for the system were either to predict the pattern on the backscreen given a specific configuration of magnets and blockers or to generate a specific pattern on the backscreen by creating a specific configuration.\n\n"}

According to the so-called Matthew effect (Merton 1968 ), eminent scientists receive  disproportionately greater credit for their work, while lesser-known scientists receive  disproportionately lesser credit for similar contributions to science. Eminent scien - tists are also likely to attract disproportionately greater amounts of resources such as  funding, which may give them better opportunities to engage in resource-intensive  OIS practices. Research on the \u2018star scientist\u2019 effect (Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong  2002 ) has shown that some scientists exhibit both superior scientific and entrepre - neurial performance, thus playing a key role in the advancement and commercia - lisation of science.\n### Input: What is the Matthew effect and how does it impact the distribution of credit and resources among scientists?\n### Response: The Matthew effect, as described in the text, refers to the phenomenon where eminent scientists receive disproportionately greater credit for their work compared to lesser-known scientists who receive disproportionately lesser credit for similar contributions. This effect also extends to the distribution of resources such as funding, where eminent scientists are likely to attract disproportionately greater amounts. This could potentially provide them with better opportunities to engage in resource-intensive practices.\n\n"}

In the short term, these developments may well be more time- and resource-intensive. But in the long run, they promise efficiencies in terms of reducing unnecessary duplication and allowing scientists to address new problems by \u2018standing on the shoulders of a taller giant\u2019 (Arza and Fressoli 2017 , 465). Thus, gaining a better understanding of mechanisms that facilitate openness and collaboration in science can optimise the application of OIS practices, unlocking these system-level efficiencies and clearing a path for more impactful research.\n### Input: What are the potential long-term efficiencies of open and collaborative practices in science, according to Arza and Fressoli (2017)?\n### Response: The potential long-term efficiencies of open and collaborative practices in science, according to Arza and Fressoli (2017), include reducing unnecessary duplication and allowing scientists to address new problems by 'standing on the shoulders of a taller giant'.\n\n"}

These might include research  funding schemes that require the application of OIS or the widespread adoption of  intellectual property mechanisms such as Creative Commons licences. Evaluation of  these measures also should not take place in isolation, but in the context of a policy  mix promoting a range of approaches to research (Cocos and Lepori 2020 ). In terms of OIS-related outcomes and impacts, advocates of OIS often assume that  OIS practices will have uniformly beneficial effects in scientific, economic, social, and  even ethical terms. However, a more critical evaluation of OIS practices has yet to be  undertaken, both theoretically and empirically. The former approach might draw on an 164  S.

Members of the public  are getting involved at the later stages of the scientific research process, such as critically  reflecting on the potential consequences of particular research findings and co-  developing a suitable dissemination strategy to avoid misunderstandings while initiating  informed debates (e.g. Ganna et al. 2019 ). At the same time, the responsible research and  innovation movement has emphasised the involvement of citizens before research  projects even begin, through processes of priority setting and anticipatory governance.  This approach comes with a responsibility for all involved stakeholders to become  mutually responsive and to consider the societal implications of research and innovation  activities (e.g. European Commision 2013 ; Owen, Macnaghten, and Stilgoe 2012 ).\n### Input: What is the role of the public in the later stages of the scientific research process and how does this relate to the responsible research and innovation movement?\n### Response: The public's role in the later stages of the scientific research process involves critically reflecting on the potential consequences of specific research findings and co-developing a suitable dissemination strategy to avoid misunderstandings and initiate informed debates.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: In conclusion, the models developed through our work with Skill Lab illustrate the viability of a crowdsourcing approach in validating a cognitive assessment tool, which has several key implications. First, it allows scientists to create better human cognition models and test and validate cognitive abilities, potentially providing ef\ufb01cient ways to scale insights into particular cognitive abilities and how they are related to solving problems (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone, 2010). Second, we have generated a unique and open data set, which includes normative benchmarks, that can be used as a basis for other studies. Finally, Skill Lab allows normative data for diverse populations, cultures, and languages to be collected in the future, facilitating the much-needed broadening of the samples typically tested in psychological and social science studies (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). An advantage of Skill Lab over traditional tests is that it is faster to play all six games once than to go through all the traditional cognitive tasks. Thus, the games could provide a low-cost self-administered test suitable for extensive deployment. This could be of great value to, for example, the psychiatric sector in which current cognitive test batteries are burdensome to administer (Baune et al., 2018), leading to cognitive impairments often going unrecognized (Groves, Douglas, & Porter, 2018; Jaeger, Berns, Uzelac, & Davis-Conway, 2006).\n### Input: What are the key implications of using a crowdsourcing approach in validating a cognitive assessment tool as illustrated by the models developed through work with Skill Lab?\n### Response: The key implications of using a crowdsourcing approach in validating a cognitive assessment tool, as illustrated by the models developed through work with Skill Lab, include the ability for scientists to create better human cognition models and test and validate cognitive abilities. This could potentially provide efficient ways to scale insights into specific cognitive abilities and their relation to problem-solving. The approach also allows for the generation of a unique and open data set, including normative benchmarks, that can be used as a basis for other studies. Furthermore, Skill Lab allows for the collection of normative data for diverse populations, cultures, and languages in the future, facilitating a much-needed broadening of the samples typically tested in psychological and social science studies. An additional advantage is that Skill Lab is faster and less burdensome to administer than traditional cognitive tests, making it a low-cost, self-administered test suitable for extensive deployment, such as in the psychiatric sector.\n\n"}

As a result, they are continually exposed to the periphery of their discipline-culture, where there are alternative viewpoints and developing theories which are not fully understood. This characteristic is both valuable and accessible to highlight through outreach, whereby participants are puzzled with understanding the world. Thus activities should offer a means to place the participants in the realm of the periphery, encouraging their scienti\ufb01c thinking and highlighting the evolving nature of the \ufb01eld. The culturo-scienti\ufb01c approach to outreach has been designed with these considerations in mind. We propose that activities follow the structure of the disciplinary thinking process, supporting this scienti\ufb01c role-play, whereas the overall narrative takes participants on a journey through the discipline-culture. Such storytelling structure (shown in Figure 2) has the potential to highlight that, particularly in the rapidly developing \ufb01elds in which we focus, disciplinary knowledge is an unfolding dialogue of ideas, to which participants have the opportunity to contribute their own creativity. \n### Input: What is the culturo-scientific approach to outreach and how does it encourage scientific thinking and understanding of evolving disciplines?\n### Response: The culturo-scientific approach to outreach is designed to expose participants to the periphery of a scientific discipline-culture, where alternative viewpoints and developing theories exist.

When researchers engage with communities facing health-related stigma, they increasingly turn to participatory methods in order to center community perspectives and to unlearn conventional research practices that reinforce social distance (Wallerstein & Duran 2017). In particular, there is some existing scholarship on the suitability of different tools and methods when it comes to the involvement of persons with intellectual disabilities in research (see Nind 2008).

Crea.visions was first developed in 2020 and has undergone four design iterations [ 22,23]. The newest iteration, crea.visions Paris, is specifically designed to facilitate CPS around complex socio-scientific and cultural issues. The tool features a two-step interaction (see Figure 1): first, a GAN-based application developed in the game engine Unity, which allows users to blend the style and content of source images, creating new images. The content refers to large-scale features and shapes (e.g., buildings, trees) while the style captures small-scale features and texture of other images. Users are presented with four source images that can be freely \u2018swapped\u2019 with alternative images (125 possible images). Users adjust sliders to manipulate the style and content of the four source images. The limits in scope and granularity of detail in the GAN generated images inspired the incorporation of a second step using stable diffusion, which allows users to create images using text prompts. We used the model implemented on playground.ai in the crea.visions iteration presented here. This feature (stable diffusion) allows users to add a higher level of detail and incorporate specific components, such as impresionist style or smoke, which were not possible with the GAN-based system alone, while the GAN model ensures base images represent diverse aspects of a specific, contextually relevant location (in this case, Paris, France), not just iconic landmarks or tourist attractions. This is crucial for the experiment, as Parisian participants ideated about problems they encounter daily, which extend beyond popular tourist spots. Initial testing revealed that stable diffusion mode alone produced images focused on iconic Paris locations. For the GAN component, the StyleGAN model was retrained [ 15] on images from the online platform Artbreeder [ 17] and Parisian buildings. In order to maintain the diversity of the pre-trained StyleGAN model and achieve the continuous building-like latent space needed for this application, the standard training procedure for StyleGAN was used. The retraining set was composed of 3,237 images, 2,744 of which were crowdsourced photos taken of Paris by our local partners. The rest of the images were generated by the original model and taken from freely accessible stock images.\n### Input: What is the purpose of the crea.visions tool and how does it incorporate GAN and stable diffusion modalities in its design?\n### Response: The crea.visions tool is designed to assist the public in envisioning possible futures, particularly around complex socio-scientific and cultural issues. The latest iteration, crea.visions Paris, incorporates GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and stable diffusion modalities in a two-step interaction. The first step involves a GAN-based application that allows users to blend the style and content of source images to create new images. The second step uses stable diffusion, which allows users to create images using text prompts, adding a higher level of detail and specific components that were not possible with the GAN-based system alone. The GAN model ensures base images represent diverse aspects of a specific location, in this case, Paris, France. The StyleGAN model was retrained on images from the online platform Artbreeder and Parisian buildings to maintain diversity and achieve the continuous building-like latent space needed for this application.\n\n"}

We, therefore, contend that future research should rely on an overall categorization of the type of fitness landscape at hand, which could then shed light on which search algorithms to apply in a given situation [22]. This also points to a need to engage in further and wider comparisons of the NK fitness landscape features with characteristics found in the empirical world [23], in both terms of the task structure and the search behavior encountered in the empirical world.\n### Input: What is the proposed future direction for research regarding the classification of the ruggedness of a fitness landscape?\n### Response: The proposed future direction for research regarding the classification of the ruggedness of a fitness landscape is to move beyond a simple numerical classification and instead rely on an overall categorization of the type of fitness landscape at hand.

(2020) implemented a Bayesian volunteer learning model to optimize training of newcomers by directing the flow of image classification tasks so that they learn more quickly while meaningfully contributing to the project at the same time. As a last example, Xue et al. (2016) applied an agent behavior model to reduce bias by optimizing incentives to motivate participants to collect data from understudied locations. With these ever-improving AI technologies comes an abundance of opportunities for CS projects to distribute tasks more efficiently among humans and machines, to support the participants in solving the tasks, and to enhance the humans\u2019 experience and consequently enhance their contribution.\n### Input: What opportunities do improving AI technologies present for Citizen Science projects in terms of task distribution, participant support, and enhancing human experience and contribution?\n### Response: Improving AI technologies present several opportunities for Citizen Science projects. In terms of task distribution, AI can optimize the flow of tasks, such as image classification, to newcomers so they can learn more quickly while also contributing to the project. For participant support, AI can be used to implement learning models that help train volunteers more effectively. In terms of enhancing human experience and contribution, AI can be used to reduce bias by optimizing incentives, motivating participants to collect data from understudied locations. Overall, these technologies can make the process more efficient and enhance the contribution of participants.\n\n"}

CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have shown how Quantum Composer can be applied to a comprehensive exercise that covers a variety of topics. Our data show that student Outcomes are largely tied to Composer interactions, speci\ufb01cally those in which stu- dents use Composer to inspect and explore a system. There- fore, these data support the hypothesis that student reasoning regarding quantum mechanical phenomena is supported by the visualizations facilitated by Composer. Future work will focus on bolstering these initial conclusions with data from three more interviews. In addition, we will explore more in-depth cross-coding between Outcomes ,Interactions , and Concepts . With this, we hope to broaden the scope of Com- poser\u2019s use both in the classroom and future physics educa- tion research.\n### Input: What future plans are outlined to further support the initial conclusions about the use of Quantum Composer in student learning and reasoning of quantum mechanical phenomena?\n### Response: The future plans outlined to further support the initial conclusions about the use of Quantum Composer in student learning and reasoning of quantum mechanical phenomena include collecting data from three more interviews and exploring more in-depth cross-coding between Outcomes, Interactions, and Concepts.

Doing so, the AI may either provide a problem-related input to the CS participant during the task, or process the participant\u2019s input to achieve or improve the solution. In other words, one could say that assistance in solving the CS task occurs when the AI is applied inside of the CS task.

Can it be assimilated with the \u201cinfluencing human behavior\u201d AI application category mentioned above?

In other words, participants can learn from the AI, but the AI cannot learn from the participants. The model was previously trained in an OffSA using obtained outside of the CS platform and passed into the OnSA (arrow g). This scheme can increase efficiency and quality of the task solutions, combining strengths of humans and machines to provide superior outcomes (HI criteria of Collectiveness and Superiority). Among the investigated projects, this scheme is applied in EyeWire (Kim et al. 2014) and iNaturalist (iNaturalist 2021). It is worth mentioning in Foldit (Cooper et al. 2010) and Quantum Moves (Jensen et al. 2021) participants can engage with algorithmic optimizers (not AI) leading to a similar increase in participants\u2019 learning and productivity.\n### Input: What is the role of a pre-trained AI model in the second tier of the OnSA scheme and how does it contribute to the efficiency and quality of task solutions?\n### Response: In the second tier of the OnSA scheme, a pre-trained AI model is used as a component to assist participants with the task. The AI model, which was previously trained outside of the CS platform, can provide guidance to the participants, but it does not learn from them. This setup can enhance the efficiency and quality of task solutions by combining the strengths of humans and machines, leading to superior outcomes. This is in line with the HI criteria of Collectiveness and Superiority. The AI model contributes to the efficiency and quality of task solutions by providing insights and guidance based on its pre-existing training, thereby enhancing the participants' learning and productivity.\n\n"}

To this end, both citizen science and crowd science may use crowdsourcing  techniques to organise scientific projects. Crowdsourcing is defined as \u2018the act of out- sourcing a task to a \u201ccrowd\u201d rather than to a designated \u201cagent\u201d (an organisation,  informal or formal team, or individual) such as a contractor, in the form of an open  call\u2019 (Afuah and Tucci 2012 , 355). Since it can be difficult to know ex ante who is best able  to solve problems, broadcasting them to a large and open crowd invites problem-solvers  to self-select into participation (Lakhani et al. 2007 ; Tucci, Afuah, and Viscusi 2018 ).  However, citizen and crowd science are OIS practices that have mostly been used for  producing scientific inputs (e.g. collecting or coding data).\n### Input: What is the potential strength of citizen and crowd science in expanding areas of scientific inquiry and efficiency?\n### Response: The potential strength of citizen and crowd science in expanding areas of scientific inquiry and efficiency lies in their ability to draw on larger bases of contributors.

Originally discussed in the context of changing research and development strategies at private-sector firms (Chesbrough 2003), OI has since been defined more generally as a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organisational and sectoral boundaries using pecuniary or nonpecuniary mechanisms (Bogers et al. 2017). OI entails a paradigm shift towards open and collaborative processes that increasingly displace and compete with producer-driven innovation, through practices that can take place outside (Baldwin and Von Hippel 2011) and between organisational boundaries (Chesbrough and Bogers 2014). OI practices embrace different inbound, outbound, and coupled processes for facilitating knowledge flows across boundaries with the purpose of generating innovations. Such practices include, but are not limited to, co-creating innovation between firms, lead users and user innovation communities, open-source software\/hardware development, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, patenting and licensing, or R&D collaborations (Dahlander and Gann 2010; Grimpe and Kaiser 2010; Jeppesen and Frederiksen 2006; Laursen and Salter 2006; Lilien et al. 2002; Poetz and Schreier 2012; Von Hippel and Von Krogh 2003).\n### Input: What are some practices associated with Open Innovation for facilitating knowledge flows across boundaries to generate innovations?\n### Response: Some practices associated with Open Innovation for facilitating knowledge flows across boundaries to generate innovations include co-creating innovation between firms, lead users and user innovation communities, open-source software\/hardware development, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, patenting and licensing, and R&D collaborations.\n\n"}

Therefore, commercial applications may tend to focus more narrowly on short-term efficiency maximization using shallower, but predictable human involvement (Rafner et al., 2022). In contrast, CitSci is fueled by a desire to solve concrete tasks and to generate intrinsic value for participants, a motivation at the heart of the growing and closely related field of AI for social good (Bondi et al., 2021; Hsu et al., 2022). We argue that the combination of these practical and value-based considerations make CitSci particularly well-suited to develop hybrid intelligence into concrete projects. These in turn, can benefit AI as a field as well as bringing value to CitSci projects, their participants, and science and society at large.\n### Input: What makes Citizen Science (CitSci) particularly well-suited to develop hybrid intelligence into concrete projects, according to the text?\n### Response: According to the text, Citizen Science (CitSci) is particularly well-suited to develop hybrid intelligence into concrete projects due to its practical and value-based considerations.

The underlying fitness function is identical, yet the visualization shows that the \u201cchunking\u201d landscape turns out to be much smoother than the one-bit-flip landscape and even more so for the bit string landscape. Since the H-XOR function has 2 (N\/2) local optima for the one-bit-flip hill-climber (as illustrated by the two global peaks in Figure 3(c)), the probability that a given point in the one-bit landscape is connected with a path to the global optimum is significantly lower as compared to the chunking algorithm (Figure 3(d)). In other words, this problem is \u201cdeceptive\u201d for a one-bit-flip hill-climber but not for an agent relying on a problem representation that can exploit the problem structure. Again, a simple K\/N ratio does not capture this type of feature of the landscape and it is not possible to disentangle assumptions about search behavior and the assessment of the fitness landscape characteristics.\n### Input: What does the visualization of the \"chunking\" landscape and one-bit-flip landscape indicate about the underlying fitness function and the effectiveness of different problem representations in exploiting the problem structure?\n### Response: The visualization indicates that the underlying fitness function is identical for both the \"chunking\" landscape and the one-bit-flip landscape. However, the \"chunking\" landscape appears to be smoother than the one-bit-flip landscape, and even more so than the bit string landscape. This suggests that the chunking algorithm is more effective at exploiting the problem structure, as it has a higher probability of connecting a given point in the landscape with a path to the global optimum. On the other hand, the one-bit-flip hill-climber is more likely to be \"deceptive\", meaning it may not lead to the global optimum. This indicates that the effectiveness of different problem representations can significantly impact the ability to exploit the problem structure.\n\n"}

Instead, they leave with an understanding that there will always be new features of their field to  understand. Scientists are always at the edge of the periphery. This culturo-scientific storytelling shares features with the day-to-day journey of the scientist. It is intended that not only the overall structure, but also the outreach activities themselves, should reflect this journey, and th us each should make use of the scientific thinking cycle (Figure 2b). Creative model-bui lding, application, observation, and refine- ment should be present. There is also a close analogy between this narrative and that of the temporal development of the field itself. Indeed, this is no surprise, as the DC is inherently constructed over time by the entire scienti\ufb01c community, each individual engaged in their own research narrative and contributing to a whole.\n### Input: What is the significance of the scientific thinking cycle in the narrative of a scientist's journey and the development of their field?\n### Response: The scientific thinking cycle is significant in the narrative of a scientist's journey and the development of their field as it reflects the ongoing process of discovery and understanding. It emphasizes that the journey of a scientist is not about reaching a final, comprehensive understanding, but rather about continuous exploration and learning. The cycle of creative model-building, application, observation, and refinement mirrors the day-to-day activities of a scientist. It also parallels the temporal development of the field, as the scientific community collectively contributes to the evolving body of knowledge over time.\n\n"}

The student is using the visualizations from Composer (Fig. 1(b)) to formulate an understanding of how a localized state tunnels between two wells. In some cases, we found that students would use something they learned or recalled with the help of Composer (coded as Discovery orRecollection , respectively) to rethink an incor- rect prediction and subsequently make a correct prediction later in the exercise. For example, I2 initially did not predict that the probability density of an eigenstate would be station- ary in time. Using Composer helped them to recall what they had learned in class (coded as Recollection ), as shown below. Oh, I need the probability density...and here we go. Let\u2019s see. There\u2019s something wrong...why isn\u2019t that moving more?...Oh, okay. So this part, I thought earlier would be moving. [It] doesn\u2019t move because it\u2019s the probability. But it makes sense, actually, from the theory that I have learned. Later in the exercise, when asked to predict the dynamics of the \ufb01rst excited state, I2 indicates a change in thinking, stating \u201cNow I have learned that the probability density would also look the same [as time evolves].\u201d This quote shows that I2 has developed an improved understanding in the earlier part of the exercise and applied this to make a correct prediction.\n### Input: What is the role of the Composer tool in helping students understand the behavior of a system and correct their predictions?\n### Response: The Composer tool aids students in visualizing the behavior of a system, which in turn helps them to formulate an understanding of the system's dynamics. It also assists them in identifying new understandings not previously identified. In some cases, the Composer tool helps students recall what they have learned in class, allowing them to rethink incorrect predictions and make correct ones later in the exercise. For example, one student was able to use the tool to recall the concept of probability density and correct their initial misunderstanding about its behavior over time.\n\n"}

This is related to the difficulty of a landscape for an agent's search strategy because it suggests that the difficulty of a landscape is not inherent, but rather depends on the agent's prevalent search strategy. The more rugged the landscape, the more complex or difficult it might be for the agent to navigate, especially if the agent is using a local-search strategy due to cognitive myopia.\n\n"}

This requires a very high learning rate for the AI, raising the risk of overfitting and ceasing to be useful on the task (i.e. the AI agreeing with the individual on all actions). Due to large numbers of participants in CS, the effect of an individual on the final result, e.g. an AI model, tends to be rather small (often intentionally so). Nevertheless, a quickly learning AI might still be useful in some tasks, for example when it is crucial to extract the strategy of an individual.\n### Input: What are the potential risks and benefits of using a quickly learning AI in collaborative systems with large numbers of participants?\n### Response: The potential benefits of using a quickly learning AI in collaborative systems with large numbers of participants include the ability for participants to experience the effect of their actions on the AI, which could be crucial in tasks where it's important to extract the strategy of an individual.

Additionally, although AI methodologies are starting to be applied in CS projects, little attention has been given to bi-directional human-computer interactions. We argue that the combination of these practical and value-based considerations make CS particularly well-suited to develop approaches combining human and artificial intelligence, i.e. hybrid intelligence, into concrete projects that will benefit the field of AI, the CS projects and participants, and science and society at large.\n### Input: How can the field of Computer Science, with its practical and value-based considerations, benefit from the development of hybrid intelligence in terms of advancing AI, benefiting CS projects and participants, and impacting science and society at large?\n### Response: The field of Computer Science (CS) can benefit from the development of hybrid intelligence in several ways. Firstly, it can advance AI by applying AI methodologies in CS projects, which can lead to the development of more sophisticated and efficient AI systems. Secondly, it can benefit CS projects and participants by generating intrinsic value through deep and meaningful involvement in the projects. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions to concrete tasks. Lastly, the development of hybrid intelligence can have a significant impact on science and society at large.

This emphasises the need to better understand the time scales and rhythms of interaction between stakeholders for different OIS practices (Delvenne and Macq 2019 ). Conflicting goals may also complicate potential synergies between different OIS practices and stakeholders, as firms require appropriation and patenting while scientists may prefer openness of data and results (Vedel and Irwin 2017 ). To this end, the development of a multi-dimensional measurement scale of OIS practices, which captures the intensity of effort when applying certain practices alone or in combination, may be beneficial. This would allow future studies INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION  163.\n### Input: What is the importance of understanding the time scales and rhythms of interaction between stakeholders for different Open Innovation System (OIS) practices and how can the development of a multi-dimensional measurement scale of OIS practices be beneficial?\n### Response: Understanding the time scales and rhythms of interaction between stakeholders for different Open Innovation System (OIS) practices is important due to the long-term nature of many scientific projects. This understanding can help manage the more intense and longer-term engagement required in these projects compared to shorter innovation processes. It can also help navigate potential conflicts between different OIS practices and stakeholders, such as the differing goals of firms and scientists regarding data openness and patenting.\n\nThe development of a multi-dimensional measurement scale of OIS practices can be beneficial in capturing the intensity of effort when applying certain practices alone or in combination.

By self-contained model, we mean a task that can be unambiguously and automatically evaluated (scored) in terms of how well a candidate solution solves the problem without any further human input. These are problems that can often - in theory - be solved purely by machine computation, but in practice may become intractable due to high complexity of the solution space. Naturally, these tasks lend themselves well to ML methods related to optimization in complex spaces, such as reinforcement learning (RL).\n### Input: What does a self-contained model refer to in the context of optimization tasks and how does it relate to machine learning methods like reinforcement learning?\n### Response: A self-contained model in the context of optimization tasks refers to a task that can be unambiguously and automatically evaluated or scored in terms of how well a candidate solution solves the problem without any further human input. This means that the task is fully defined and can be solved purely by machine computation. However, due to the high complexity of the solution space, these tasks may become intractable in practice. These types of tasks are well-suited to machine learning methods related to optimization in complex spaces, such as reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is capable of learning from its environment by interacting with it and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions, which makes it suitable for solving these complex optimization tasks.\n\n"}

For example, the creation of new markets in connection with Open Science may allow \u2018platform capitalists\u2019 to capture value from scientific knowledge without creating significant value for the science system (Mirowski 2018), a circumstance which highlights the importance of suitable appropriation strategies. \n### Input: What are the potential negative impacts of developments in science, such as the creation of new markets in connection with Open Science, and how can suitable appropriation strategies address these issues?\n### Response: The text suggests that one potential negative impact of developments in science, such as the creation of new markets in connection with Open Science, is the possibility of 'platform capitalists' capturing value from scientific knowledge without creating significant value for the science system. This could potentially lead to a skewed distribution of benefits, where the science system, which is the source of the knowledge, does not receive its fair share of the value generated. \n\nSuitable appropriation strategies could address these issues by ensuring that the value generated from scientific knowledge is equitably distributed. This could involve implementing policies or mechanisms that ensure a fair return to the science system when its knowledge is used for commercial gain. The text does not provide specific examples of what these strategies might be, but they could potentially involve things like licensing agreements, royalties, or other forms of revenue sharing.\n\n"}

Divergent thinking (DT) is defined as the ability to come up with many different solutions to a prompt, whereas convergent thinking (CT) is defined as the ability to find the single best solution to a defined question [ 21]. Although Guilford drew attention to and acknowledged the importance of both processes, creativity quickly became equated with DT, leading to the majority of assessment instruments focusing on measuring DT [ 22]. These instruments often operationalize DT following Guilford\u2019s [ 23] proposal, in terms of ideational fluency (the number of outputs: ideas, products, solutions), flexibility (how different the proposed outputs are from each other), originality (how unique an output is), and elaboration (the level of details in an output).\n### Input: What are the two essential processes of creative thinking conceptualized by Guilford and how are they defined?\n### Response: The two essential processes of creative thinking conceptualized by Guilford are divergent thinking and convergent thinking.

Different types of sharing economies and frameworks provide various opportunities, but also raise questions about the ethical usage of data and its reuse in research and development (see, for example, Courbier et al. (2019), who provide an overview on risks and potentials as well as recommendations for sharing and protecting health data). Open access to data might undermine participants\u2019 trust that their data are handled with care. In this scenario, readiness to provide data or to take part in studies might be limited. A model of full commercialization of data might have similar effects for studies and surveys that see patients and participants only as data bonanzas. On the other hand, commercialization and privately driven research and development will ultimately provide better medical devices and treatments, in spite of all reservations. Even a public approach or emphasis on public value is not the answer to all\n### Input: What are the potential ethical concerns and benefits associated with different approaches to data access and commercialization in the context of health research and development?\n### Response: The text suggests that different approaches to data access and commercialization in the context of health research and development can raise ethical concerns about the usage and reuse of data. For instance, open access to data might undermine participants' trust in how their data is handled, potentially limiting their willingness to provide data or participate in studies. Similarly, a model of full commercialization of data might view patients and participants merely as sources of data, which could also affect their participation. However, the text also suggests that commercialization and privately driven research and development could ultimately lead to better medical devices and treatments, despite these ethical concerns. The text implies that a public approach or emphasis on public value might not resolve all these issues.\n\n"}

In the lab, the participant is supervised to ensure comprehension of the instructions and attention to the activity (Casaletto & Heaton, 2017 ). These types of studies find participants through open calls (flyers, etc.), via teaching, and often offer compensation. In many cases social scientists have turned to paid, recruiting platforms such as mTurk and Prolific in order to scale up sample sizes (Casler, Bickel, Hackett, 2013 ); however, these platforms also have several drawbacks (Aguinis, Villamor, & Ramani, 2021 ; Huber & Oded, 2017 ). For example (Pedersen et al., 2020 ), compared data from mTurk participants and data from volunteer players in a series of game-based cognitive ability tasks, showing detrimental trends in parts of the mTurk data set where participants sacrificed accuracy for speedy task completion.\n### Input: What are some of the drawbacks of using paid recruiting platforms such as mTurk and Prolific for behavioral studies?\n### Response: The text mentions that one of the drawbacks of using paid recruiting platforms such as mTurk and Prolific for behavioral studies is that participants may sacrifice accuracy for speedy task completion.

Co-creative systems are systems in which humans and computers (often with Machine Learning) col- laborate on a creative task. This human-computer collaboration raises questions about the relevance and level of human creativity and involvement in the process. We expand on, and explore aspects of these questions in this pilot study. We observe participants play through three different play modes in crea.blender, each aligned with established creativity assessment methods. In these modes, players \u201cblend\u201d existing images into new images under varying constraints. Our study indicates that crea.blender provides a playful experience, affords players a sense of control over the interface, and elicits different types of player behavior, supporting further study of the tool for use in a scalable, playful, creativity assessment. \n### Input: What does the pilot study on crea.blender reveal about the potential for using this tool in a scalable, playful, creativity assessment?\n### Response: The pilot study on crea.blender reveals that the tool provides a playful experience, gives players a sense of control over the interface, and elicits different types of player behavior.

Tucci OIS use problem: Tensions in knowledge sharing among competing research groups Proposal abstract: Different research groups at CERN sometimes pursue similar research agendas. However, they do not always share their intermediary results and findings with each other. Whereas prior research on knowledge sharing has largely focused on individual scientists, we propose to investigate predictors of sharing\/collaboration between research teams. First, we consider that teams are typically composed of heterogeneous members, e.g., senior and junior scientists. These members may have different perceptions of costs and benefits of sharing\/collaboration, e.g., related to competitive considerations or labor market opportunities, leading to potentially conflicting attitudes towards collaboration with other teams. Second, whether and how these diverging individual attitudes shape the team\u2019s sharing\/collaboration patterns may be related to internal governance structures, i.e., the degree to which decisions are centralized versus made openly by involving all team members. The proposal outlines surveys and interviews as possible approaches to examine these mechanisms empirically.\n### Input: How do individual attitudes towards collaboration and internal governance structures within research teams at CERN influence their patterns of knowledge sharing and collaboration with other teams?\n### Response: The individual attitudes towards collaboration and internal governance structures within research teams at CERN can significantly influence their patterns of knowledge sharing and collaboration with other teams. Team members, such as senior and junior scientists, may have different perceptions of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration. These perceptions can be influenced by factors such as competitive considerations or labor market opportunities. These potentially conflicting attitudes can shape the team's sharing and collaboration patterns. Furthermore, the degree to which decisions are centralized or made openly by involving all team members, i.e., the internal governance structures, can also impact these patterns. For instance, teams with more open governance may be more likely to share knowledge and collaborate with other teams. The proposal suggests conducting surveys and interviews to empirically examine these mechanisms.\n\n"}

In these tasks, the participant needs to continually (audio- visually) survey the environment and\/or consider the suitability of deploying a sensor for recording data (Camprodon et al., 2019; Cochran et al., 2009; D\u2019Hondt, Stevens and Jacobs, 2013; Van Horn et al., 2018). The machine analogy of the data collection task would be robotics and smart sensors. In smart sensors, the raw measurement data is processed locally in the hardware before being passed to a central data storage for further processing (Cartwright et al. 2019, Kim et al. 2010). Advanced robotics would include adaptable sensors which adapt (e.g. move location) independently. Note that even the deployment of a stationary sensor includes complex cognitive and socio-technical considerations such as evaluation of the environment in terms of e.g. degradation of the sensor or risk of theft.\n### Input: What is the machine analogy of the data collection task in physical tasks and how does it function?\n### Response: The machine analogy of the data collection task in physical tasks is robotics and smart sensors.

RQ1 and RQ2 concern the team level of analysis. As such, quantitative analysis would require data on a large number of teams, using measures of governance, team diversity, and observed knowledge sharing and collaboration behaviors (see Fig. 1). At CERN, the number of research groups is limited, but each group is very large. This context may be more amenable for qualitative research into decision making processes within research groups and interactions between groups. This research could also gather rich qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members. It would be particularly interesting to compare governance and decision making processes across groups that seem to exhibit different levels of openness and collaboration. Archival data on knowledge exchange (e.g., meeting records) and on collaborations (e.g., co-authored articles) would also be valuable. RQ3 concerns the individual level of analysis. If conceptual work based on existing theories does not lead to clear predictions regarding the relationships in Fig. 2, qualitative work (e.g., interviews and case studies) could be useful to build a stronger theory. If predictions are sufficiently strong, a survey of both junior and senior scientists could be used to test predictions. Among other findings, such a survey could collect data on individual status within the team (e.g., junior vs. senior), perceptions of different types of costs and benefits from.\n### Input: What methods could be used to gather qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members in research groups at CERN?\n### Response: The text suggests that qualitative research into decision making processes within research groups and interactions between groups could be used to gather qualitative insights into the perspectives of junior and senior members in research groups at CERN.

To get there it will require us to rethink how we study and measure cognitive abilities. Most of what social scientists know about cognitive abilities and psychological behaviour has been gleaned from studying university undergraduates in the laboratory. It has become clear, however, that many of these \u2013 often underpowered \u2013 results may not generalize across populations, let alone to samples from non-Western cultures. The social sciences are therefore undergoing a revolution to increase the diversity of those studied1. Furthermore, in-person testing is costly, inconvenient to participants, and sometimes confounded by issues such as experimenter expectations and behaviours2. Until these problems are solved, individual cognitive phenotyping and ambitions such as precision psychiatry will remain an illusion.\n### Input: What are the challenges and limitations of current methods in studying and measuring cognitive abilities, and how might they impact the development of individual cognitive phenotyping and precision psychiatry?\n### Response: The current methods of studying and measuring cognitive abilities face several challenges and limitations. Firstly, most of the knowledge about cognitive abilities and psychological behavior is derived from studying university undergraduates in the laboratory. This approach may not yield results that are generalizable across different populations, especially those from non-Western cultures. Secondly, in-person testing, which is commonly used, is not only costly and inconvenient for participants, but also potentially confounded by issues such as experimenter expectations and behaviors. These limitations could hinder the development of individual cognitive phenotyping and precision psychiatry by providing a skewed or incomplete understanding of cognitive abilities.

Some of these tools have been used to study aspects of student understanding of quantum mechanics, in- cluding wavefunction time-dependence [13], tunneling [23], and expectation values [24]. These simulations are modular in that a speci\ufb01c tool typically addresses a small subset of concepts, and a curriculum is built around the tools to foster student understanding. One of the broadest research ques- tions one can ask of such a simulation and visualization tool is simply: does use of the tool affect student reasoning re- garding quantum mechanical concepts, and if so, how? \n### Input: What impact does the use of quantum visualization tools, such as PhET, QuVIS, and QuILT simulations, have on student understanding and reasoning of quantum mechanical concepts?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific details on the impact of using quantum visualization tools like PhET, QuVIS, and QuILT simulations on student understanding and reasoning of quantum mechanical concepts.\n\n"}

Meanwhile, leading publications are emphasizing the co-production of scientific research as a potentially powerful remedy to this development (Nature 2018, 2021, Fortunato et al. 2018, Beck et al. 2021). Co-production of scientific research refers to the joint effort of producers (i.e., academic scientists1) and \u201cusers\u201d of scientific knowledge. Here, users can take diverse forms such as active peer-users like practitioners or researchers using existing studies to do further research (e.g., Rappert 1997); end-users such as patients who undergo treatment and therapies based on medical research, farmers benefiting from agricultural research, or companies from management research (e.g., Joho et al. 2010); and science hobbyists who engage with science, whether for purely intellectual reasons (e.g., Corin et al. 2017) or to make use of scientific knowledge in shaping public discourse, including as anti-science activists (e.g., Swim et al. 2014). \n### Input: What is the purpose and process of co-developing research proposals in the context of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) practices?\n### Response: The purpose of co-developing research proposals in the context of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) practices is to address the productivity crisis in scientific knowledge production, which is marked by increasing incrementalism. The process involves the co-production of scientific research, which refers to the joint effort of producers (academic scientists) and various \"users\" of scientific knowledge. These users can be active peer-users like practitioners or researchers using existing studies for further research, end-users such as patients, farmers, or companies who benefit from the research, and science hobbyists who engage with science for intellectual reasons or to shape public discourse. This approach is seen as a potentially powerful remedy to the productivity crisis in scientific research.\n\n"}

Recent advances in biology point to theexistence of higher-order epistatic interactions, whichgenerate multidimensional landscapes [43, 44]. WZ_hese in-teractions seem to be organized hierarchically in functionalmodules that interact with each other [44, 45]. WZ_his type ofinteraction structure is reminiscent of the hierarchicalstructure,whichhasbeenarguedtobeanessentialfeatureoforganizational problems, at least when it comes to inno-vation problems [21, 46, 47]. In this context, hierarchy isconceptualized as the composition of systems out of sub-systems, where each subsystem, in turn, has its own hier-archy [48] until a certain level of \ufb01ne-grained modularity isachieved. WZ_his is a qualitatively di\ufb00erent kind of \u201cproblemcomplexity\u201d (as compared to landscape \u201cruggedness\u201d) andthe one most likely to be encountered in real-life problems[47\u201349].\n### Input: What is the role of hierarchy in the structure of higher-order epistatic interactions in biology and how does it relate to problem complexity in real-life problems?\n### Response: The hierarchy in the structure of higher-order epistatic interactions in biology is conceptualized as the composition of systems out of subsystems, with each subsystem having its own hierarchy until a certain level of fine-grained modularity is achieved. This hierarchical structure is similar to that found in organizational problems, particularly innovation problems. This type of problem complexity, which is qualitatively different from landscape \"ruggedness\", is most likely to be encountered in real-life problems. The hierarchical structure allows for the organization of complex interactions into manageable modules, which can be crucial in addressing and solving complex problems.\n\n"}

MTurk The MTurk sample was collected by publishing six different MTurk tasks (Human Intelligence Task, or HIT). In each HIT, MTurkers played one of the games as well as the tasks assessing the cognitive ability hypothesized to be associated with that game (see Fig. SI.14). Before launching the jobs, we made a power calculation of the sample size required for Pearson correlations to measure medium effect sizes (r > 0.3), which showed that we needed a sample of at least 85 MTurkers. To allow for removal of some outliers, we decided to recruit 100 MTurkers per HIT. We started by publishing an initial batch of nine jobs for each of the HITs in order to determine the completion time and thus what a fair payment would be. We found that each task took approximately 40 minutes to complete and thus settled on a payment of US$6 per task (US$9\/hour average); in addition, we offered a bonus for completing multiple HITs. Furthermore, if MTurkers had already completed a cognitive ability task previously, they did not have to retake the task, which enabled them to complete the job faster and thus increase their hourly wage. Each MTurker was only allowed to take one job from each of the six HITs. The tasks were released in batches of nine jobs for all HITs at the same time. The batches were released at irregular intervals at all times of day from 27th July 2018 to 2nd August 2018. The MTurkers were required to have at least 500 previously approved HITs and a 90% approval rate.

A random graph is shown and three intervals are marked as seen in Figure 1.b. When students select an interval, they are given feedba ck on whether they answered correctly or incorrectly. Finally, in the Differentiation Game the students are show n the analytical expression and the graph of a function, and need to identify the analytical expression for the de rivative given four choices. When students submit their answers, they get immediate feedback on whether the ques tion was correct or incorrect. When students click on a point on the graph of the original function, seen to the left on Figure 1.c, the tangent in that point is plotted and the slope of the function in that point - i.e. the derivative in that point \u2013 is plotted into a new coordinate system, as seen on the right on Figure 1.c. This access to dynamic \u201chints\u201d is e xpected to help the students learn how to find the derivative even in cases where the analytic form of the deri vative of the particular function has not yet been taught. Similar to Recognize Functions the game consists of two part s. In the first training part the students are given basic training, before they proceed onto the game mode, in wh ich a total of 20 exercises must be completed with less than three incorrect answers, and with less than a total of 50 hints, i.e. clicks on the original function to get help. If the student gets three wrong or answers all 20 exercises, the ga me mode stops and a score is generated based on the number of correct answers, time used on each tas k, and the amount of unused hints still left.\n### Input: What is the challenge presented to students in the \"Sign of slope\" activity?\n### Response: The challenge presented to students in the \"Sign of slope\" activity is to identify which of three intervals fulfills a specific condition for the slope (positive, negative, or zero) on a random graph.\n\n"}

Rafner et al. \/ Human Computation (2022) 9:1    67      ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) can augment and sometimes even replace human cognition, but still has many fundamental roadblocks preventing it from achieving fully autonomous applications. Inspired by the growing set of AI-implementation failures in society at large, in this opinion piece we reexamine the field of Citizen Science (CitSci) through a computational lens, highlighting algorithmic opportunities as well as uniquely human capabilities. In particular, we situate the CitSci field among human and machine computation fields and introduce two novel dimensions allowing us to match CitSci projects ranging from digital games and annotation tasks to data collection in nature to the appropriate machine learning algorithms. Interestingly, in CitSci there is an abundance of tasks drawing upon human common sense, hierarchical thinking, and complex skills which have yet to be incorporated in current AI methods. This gap, combined with the unique participant-centered set of values, makes CitSci an invaluable test bed for the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century such as hybrid intelligence. The mapping thus offers concrete algorithm selection guides to CitSci researchers as well as inspiration for AI researchers to pursue grand AI challenges through support of CitSci projects.\n### Input: What are the unique human capabilities that Citizen Science projects can offer to the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century?\n### Response: The unique human capabilities that Citizen Science projects can offer to the development of human-centered AI of the 21st century include human common sense, hierarchical thinking, and complex skills.\n\n"}

These costs, including time to format,  annotate, and curate the data, as well as concerns over privacy, \u2018scooping\u2019, and misuse,  must be balanced against the promised efficiencies of data reuse (Pronk 2019 ). One way  to reduce these costs is by (real-time) storing and sharing of certain kinds of data  automatically, without the need for human intervention (Rouder 2016 ). Another relates  to the model of data science as a service (Grossman et al. 2016 ; Mishra, Schofield, and  Bubela 2016 ), in which scientists upload their data to cloud-based service providers that  may also offer some level of processing and analysis. Meanwhile, innovations like the  open materials transfer agreement developed by the BioBricks Foundation are providing  legal frameworks for research organisations to share biological materials on an open  basis.\n### Input: What are some strategies to reduce the costs associated with preparing research data for reuse, and what are some potential benefits and concerns associated with these strategies?\n### Response: The text suggests two strategies to reduce the costs associated with preparing research data for reuse. The first strategy is the real-time storing and sharing of certain kinds of data automatically, without the need for human intervention. The second strategy is the model of data science as a service, where scientists upload their data to cloud-based service providers that may also offer some level of processing and analysis. \n\nThe potential benefits of these strategies include increased efficiency and reduced time and effort required to format, annotate, and curate the data. The use of cloud-based service providers could also provide additional services such as data processing and analysis. \n\nHowever, there are also concerns associated with these strategies. These include issues related to privacy, the risk of 'scooping' (where others use the data to publish results before the original researchers), and misuse of the data. Balancing these concerns against the potential efficiencies of data reuse is a key challenge.\n\n"}

Additionally, Outcomes would often arise as stu- dents would iterate on various parameters, indicating that stu- dents\u2019 understanding might be facilitated by Composer\u2019s \ufb02ex- ibility and ability to rapidly cycle through parameters. Inter- viewee 1 (I1) was able to reason through how the time dynam- ics of the real part, imaginary part, and probability density of a superposition state initially localized to one of the two wells changed over time through the use of all three of these Inspec- tionbehaviors. This is shown in the following quote, where the well spacing is shown in parentheses. (0.75) It\u2019s slowly moving. It\u2019s moving fast up and down and then slowly moving towards the other well, and not as \ufb02uently (sic) as before because of the potential barrier in between the two wells, but still moving over there and after some time resetting itself...then moving back again at the same pace...if I lower [the spacing between wells], it would probably move faster...(0.5)...Yep. Moving remarkably faster...if we tried to set it at one, it would still move...(1)...it\u2019s moving a little, just very, very, very slow. Okay, so the higher the spacing between the wells is, the harder it is for it to get to the other well...if we change this to 0.1, it should move back and forth almost in the [single-well] case from before. (0.1) Yep. Fluent (sic) motion back and forth, almost like with the one-well system.\n### Input: What observations did Interviewee 1 make about the movement of a superposition state in relation to the spacing between wells?\n### Response: Interviewee 1 observed that the movement of a superposition state initially localized to one of the two wells changes over time. They noted that when the well spacing is 0.75, the state moves slowly towards the other well, with its movement impeded by the potential barrier between the two wells. When the spacing is reduced to 0.5, the state moves remarkably faster. At a spacing of 1, the state still moves, but very slowly. Interviewee 1 concluded that the higher the spacing between the wells, the harder it is for the state to get to the other well. When the spacing is reduced to 0.1, the state moves back and forth almost as in the single-well case, with fluent motion.\n\n"}

Such an analysis is well beyond the scope of this work, however, we do note that many high accessibility tasks are characterized by intuitive processing and the application of common sense (information processing or physical actions that most participants can do instinctively). Finally, the meta-cognitive aspects in the Decodoku example illustrates that it would be interesting to relate the accessibility level to the emerging concept of co-created CS (Bonney et al. 2009b), in which participants are involved not just in the data gathering phase of the scientific process but also e.g. hypothesis generation, design, and analysis. The algorithmic support of the scientific processes beyond data acquisition could tap into cutting edge AI trends such as unsupervised ML, hierarchical modelling (Menon et al 2017) and generative design (McKnight 2017, Oh et al. 2019).\n### Input: What is the potential benefit of relating the accessibility level of concrete CS tasks to the concept of co-created CS, and how might this be supported by emerging AI trends such as unsupervised ML, hierarchical modelling, and generative design?\n### Response: The potential benefit of relating the accessibility level of concrete CS tasks to the concept of co-created CS is that it could involve participants not just in the data gathering phase of the scientific process but also in hypothesis generation, design, and analysis.

Other familiar outputs at this stage include patent applications and various types of one-way science communication (Davies 2008 ). But documentation and dissemination of research findings can also take more innovative forms, as with interactive digital scholarship in the humanities and social sciences that is starting to challenge the dominance of outputs like the article or monograph even as it draws researchers into new kinds of collaboration (Nowviskie 2011 ). Inviting collaborators to define relevant outputs for their communities can reduce the need for a subsequent process of research translation, even as it places demands on scientists to master new genres. In some cases, scientists may also take an active role in transforming research findings into product, service, or social innovations, whether in their role as an employee of a research organisation or by taking up a new role outside of the academic science system (e.g. Fritsch and Krabel 2012 ).

The intrinsic motivation scales showed that the students generally found the games to be fun and useful, but since the tests could not establish a relationship between level of perf ormance and high levels of intrinsic motivation, it appears that extrinsic motivation was also a driving force behind participation (similarly to conclusions drawn by Mekler et al., 2015) even if game-inspired design elements like interactivity, feedback and clear goals scaffold students to work on every tasks.   \n### Input: What is the predicted outcome of a controlled test on the DiffGame curriculum and how does it relate to student motivation?\n### Response: The predicted outcome of a controlled test on the DiffGame curriculum is that it will yield large immediate gains.

Findings like this underscore  the importance of a multi-level approach. \n### Input: What role does individual ideological conviction play in moderating the effect of discipline as a predictor of faculty support for economic development and knowledge commercialisation efforts in academic science?\n### Response: The text suggests that individual ideological convictions can moderate the effect of discipline as a predictor of faculty support for economic development and knowledge commercialisation efforts in academic science. However, the text does not provide specific details on how these convictions influence this dynamic.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: What don\u2019t we know about that OIS challenge from existing literature? Our reading of the literature cited above suggests important gaps. First, research on the organization of research teams has focused on the division of labor with respect to knowledge production, but says little about optimal decision making in scientific teams (perhaps reflecting long-standing norms that decisions are made by principal investigators). Second, most of the literature on knowledge sharing has discussed costs and benefits from the perspective of a single actor - either individual scientists or aggregate organizations. Apart from the literature on informal knowledge trading, there is little discussion of potential disagreements within organizations about optimal sharing\/collaboration, and whether such disagreements can be addressed through open governance mechanisms. Finally, the literature on science and engineering careers focuses on the incentives and rewards for scientists as individuals. Although this literature has also discussed potential incentive conflicts between junior and senior scientists (e.g., with respect to authorship or the division of labor), it has not investigated whether career considerations may lead to conflicting attitudes towards openness and collaboration.\n### Input: What gaps in the existing literature on the organization of research teams, knowledge sharing, and science and engineering careers could be addressed to better understand the OIS challenge?\n### Response: The existing literature could address several gaps to better understand the OIS challenge. Firstly, there is a lack of information on optimal decision making in scientific teams. Secondly, the literature on knowledge sharing could benefit from a discussion on potential disagreements within organizations about optimal sharing\/collaboration, and whether such disagreements can be addressed through open governance mechanisms. Lastly, the literature on science and engineering careers could investigate whether career considerations may lead to conflicting attitudes towards openness and collaboration.\n\n"}

Outcomes of OIS practices along the entire research process can also create societal impact, often understood in terms of social, cultural, environmental, and economic returns (Bornmann 2013 ). Scholarship on the societal impact of science has traditionally focused on economic impact, and evidence does suggest that open access to research findings and data can lead to savings in labour and transaction costs, as well as enable new products, services, and collaborations (Fell 2019 ). For example, open and collaborative practices of scientists have allowed drug development companies to become more profitable by avoiding parallel investments (Altshuler et al. 2010 ; Chaguturu 2014 ; Priego, Pujol, and Wareham 2019 ) and identify new market opportunities (Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson 2008 ; Rothaermel and Boeker 2008 ).\n### Input: What are some examples of the societal impact of Open Information Science (OIS) practices in the research process, particularly in terms of economic returns?\n### Response: The text mentions that open access to research findings and data can lead to savings in labour and transaction costs. It can also enable the creation of new products, services, and collaborations. For instance, open and collaborative practices of scientists have allowed drug development companies to become more profitable by avoiding parallel investments.

Rafner et al. \/ Human Computation (2022) 9:1    77      problems that can often\u2014in theory\u2014be solved purely by machine computation, but in practice may become intractable due to high complexity of the solution space. Naturally, these tasks lend themselves well to ML methods related to optimization in complex spaces, such as reinforcement learning (RL).  The degree of task digitization allows for a rough categorization of the possible AI-contribution as robotics\/smart sensors, SL, or RL respectively. One might naively expect that the pinnacle of human contribution is to solve complex mathematical problems (high degree of digitization tasks). However, in many ways the robotics\/ smart sensors capable of assisting or replacing human volunteers in the real world for physical tasks is a much more difficult problem, considering current robotics are comparably less advanced than the state-of-the-art RL technologies (Dalgaard et al., 2020, Vinyals et al., 2019). \n### Input: What is the degree of task digitization and how does it allow for a categorization of the possible AI-contribution?\n### Response: The degree of task digitization refers to the extent to which a task can be converted into a digital form or can be performed digitally. This degree allows for a categorization of the possible AI-contribution into three main categories: robotics\/smart sensors, supervised learning (SL), and reinforcement learning (RL). Robotics and smart sensors are used for tasks with a low degree of digitization, i.e., physical tasks in the real world. SL is used for tasks with a medium degree of digitization, i.e., tasks that require pattern recognition or prediction based on past data. RL, on the other hand, is used for tasks with a high degree of digitization, i.e., problems that can be solved purely by machine computation but may become intractable due to the high complexity of the solution space.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: What don\u2019t we know about that OIS challenge from existing literature? 1) So far, most approaches focus on idea generation and ignore the influence on later development stages, rapid diffusion, and applicability. However, this speed is critical for patients who, while participating as co-designers anticipate a faster time-to-market and personal benefits from the outcomes. Thus in addition to increasing the quality of innovation and reducing development risks, OIS approaches can be used to generate ideas and tools to speed up availability and scaling. Crowd funding by patients, for example, may lead to more rapid production and market availability (Snyder et al. 2020, Young & Scheinberg 2017). This is particularly relevant in areas where patient innovators are racing against time.  2) The approaches described above have so far mostly been studied in isolation. A study linking lead user, crowd\/citizen science, and patient co-creation is largely missing. We anticipate that OIS methods will generate more value by linking different practices along the development and production process. To date, however, this is rarely applied or empirically investigated.  3) Co-creation with patients requires a careful and ethical way to approach problems. We argue that capability development for patient involvement is required for all parties involved. Furthermore, patient expectations and value creation should be well-managed. We need to carefully examine our OIS tools so that they reflect the complexity of and the need for patient engagement.\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of integrating different Open Innovation in Science (OIS) methods, such as lead user, crowd\/citizen science, and patient co-creation, in the development and production process, and how can these be effectively managed to ensure ethical patient involvement and value creation?\n### Response: The potential benefits of integrating different OIS methods include increasing the quality of innovation, reducing development risks, and speeding up availability and scaling. This is particularly relevant in areas where patient innovators are racing against time. For example, crowd funding by patients may lead to more rapid production and market availability. \n\nHowever, there are also challenges. The approaches have mostly been studied in isolation, and a study linking lead user, crowd\/citizen science, and patient co-creation is largely missing. This suggests that the value generated by linking different practices along the development and production process is not yet fully understood or utilized. \n\nMoreover, co-creation with patients requires a careful and ethical approach. Capability development for patient involvement is required for all parties involved, and patient expectations and value creation should be well-managed. This means that OIS tools need to be carefully examined to ensure they reflect the complexity of and the need for patient engagement. \n\nTo effectively manage these benefits and challenges, it is suggested that more empirical investigation is needed into the integration of different OIS methods. Furthermore, a careful and ethical approach to patient involvement is required, with a focus on capability development for all parties involved and careful management of patient expectations and value creation.\n\n"}

However, just as crucial factors for AI failures are cognitive, structural, and organizational deployment issues [1]. Isolated AI solutions usually fail because they only automate human workflows without managing organizational and behavioral change. Although HCAI is derived from the human-computer interaction (HCI) field [2,3] with its solid emphasis on user centered and participatory design, it usually does not take into account the complex business workflows within a socio-technical system. \n### Input: Why do isolated AI solutions typically fail and how does the HCAI approach differ from traditional HCI methods in terms of addressing complex business workflows?\n### Response: Isolated AI solutions typically fail because they only automate human workflows without managing organizational and behavioral change. This means they do not consider the broader context of the system they are implemented in, including the social and organizational structures that may affect their success. On the other hand, HCAI, derived from the HCI field, does not typically account for the complex business workflows within a socio-technical system. This suggests that while HCI methods may focus on user-centered and participatory design, they may not fully address the complexities of business workflows and the broader socio-technical system in which they operate.\n\n"}

These 17 goals were set into place by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all [ 37]. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [ 7] are Machine Learning (ML) models that can be used as creative tools by both professional and non-professional users in a variety of contexts. Professional artists use GANs as a new medium [ 8,11,13,14], as a means of inspiring new ideas [ 4,8\u201310,15,21] or as a helping hand for laborious tasks [ 6,16,17,19,20,22].

To evaluate the similarity of the main factor loadings (Fg,iand F t,i), we compute the cosine similarity cos( \u03b8)=\/summationtextFg,iFt,i |Fg||Ft|. If the cosine similarity is 0, the main factors are orthogonal, and if it is 1, they are completely identical.\n### Input: What method is used to identify the extent to which the predictive models rely on a generalized cognitive ability in the factor analysis of cognitive abilities from games and validation tasks?\n### Response: The method used to identify the extent to which the predictive models rely on a generalized cognitive ability in the factor analysis of cognitive abilities from games and validation tasks is an exploratory factor analysis.\n\n"}

Despite the potential benefits, this results in complex demands on scientists with regards to appropriate data selection and making the data interpretable and usable by others (e.g., in terms of data format, documentation, appropriate infrastructure, ownership rights, and associated costs). Thus scientists may be reluctant (or unable) to share their data (Tenopir et al. 2011) or use the data of others (Wallis 2013). To resolve the tension between what is expected from scientists and what they want (or can) do, we examine three questions: (1) Why do policymakers require data sharing? (2) When do the benefits outweigh the costs of sharing?, and (3) How do we measure the value of data sharing and the success of data sharing policies? We propose a mixed-methods design to identify and experimentally test potential policy levers and consequently develop successful data sharing policies.\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of open data sharing in science and how can policymakers develop successful data sharing policies?\n### Response: The potential benefits of open data sharing in science include promoting transparency, fostering collaboration, and accelerating scientific discovery. However, it also presents challenges such as the complexity of selecting appropriate data, making the data interpretable and usable by others, and dealing with issues related to data format, documentation, infrastructure, ownership rights, and costs. These challenges may make scientists reluctant or unable to share their data or use the data of others. Policymakers can develop successful data sharing policies by addressing three key questions: why data sharing is required, when the benefits outweigh the costs of sharing, and how to measure the value of data sharing and the success of data sharing policies. A mixed-methods design can be used to identify and experimentally test potential policy levers to develop effective data sharing policies.\n\n"}

For example, funding schemes have seen a shift from more flexible recurrent  block funding towards project funding mechanisms that are associated with greater  precarity for early-career researchers and, arguably, less innovative research (Franssen  et al. 2018 ). This reflects a broader change in relations of authority over the govern - ance of research priorities, as the increasing exogeneity, formalisation, and substantive  nature of governance mechanisms \u2013 as well as the strength and extent of their  enforcement \u2013 have reshuffled the relative authority of different social groups over  the evaluation of research (Whitley 2011 ).156  S.

The reasons for the relatively low sample sizes in these studies could be due to the fact that achieving large sample size was not a priority, that the presented games are still in the early, laboratory stages, or due to the challenges of scaling up (e.g. technical and recruitment challenges). To elaborate on this, only three studies reported that scaling up is one of the primary reasons for using games (Shute & Wang, 2016 ; Gal et al., 2017 ; Krebs et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the nature of studies can determine the possibility for scaling up. For example, in Ali et al. (2019 ), participants physically interact with social robots which makes scaling up much more difficult than in the purely digital studies. Furthermore, Krebs et al. (2020 ) states in the abstract that the work is \u201cpreliminary data\u201d and then in the conclusion emphasizes several times the need for further studies with more participants.\n### Input: What are some reasons for the relatively low sample sizes in the reviewed studies on gaming?\n### Response: The reasons for the relatively low sample sizes in the reviewed studies on gaming could be that achieving large sample size was not a priority, the games being studied are still in the early, laboratory stages, or due to the challenges of scaling up, such as technical and recruitment challenges.

Projects such as LabintheWild3, Volunteer Science4, and TestMyBrain5 offer a broad suite of digitized tasks from cognitive and social science; researchers create and post their tasks online, to be completed by volunteers from the general public. These scientific platforms have proven immensely successful for crowdsourcing data from standardized and quickly customizable tasks as an alternative to both laboratory studies and generic crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Spurred on by this success, researchers and students alike have increasingly begun to use fee-based online services to conduct studies in the social and cognitive sciences. However, many tasks, which elicit reliable within-participant effects, may actually evoke too little variation between participants to offer reliable phenotyping6. This is largely because, in many cases, the available tasks rely on less-stimulating and generally time-consuming and repetitive conditions, in stark contrast to the reality of our daily lives.\n### Input: What are the limitations of using online crowdsourcing platforms for conducting studies in the social and cognitive sciences?\n### Response: The limitations of using online crowdsourcing platforms for conducting studies in the social and cognitive sciences include the fact that many tasks may elicit reliable within-participant effects, but evoke too little variation between participants to offer reliable phenotyping.

There is an inverse correlation between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution. Thus, the solver is drawn away from the global optimum. According to Malan and Engelbrecht\u2019s [40] classifications, these are \u201cdeceptive landscapes.\u201d Jones and Forrest thus provide a quantitatively informed qualitative assessment of how difficult a landscape is to navigate in, which, however, requires a priori knowledge of the global optimum. This is in line with a recent trend [40] arguing that we need to be able to classify landscapes and then identify which algorithm is appropriate, rather than searching for an absolute identification of the difficulty of a landscape (as K\/N). In addition to providing information about the type of fitness landscape, the fitness distance correlation also manages to capture the challenge of deceptiveness, unlike the K\/N ratio. However, Jones and Forrest [53] did not aim to capture neutrality, which still can influence the nature of the fitness landscape.\n### Input: What is the significance of the fitness distance correlation in understanding the difficulty of navigating a landscape, according to Jones and Forrest's research?\n### Response: According to Jones and Forrest's research, the fitness distance correlation is significant in understanding the difficulty of navigating a landscape as it provides a quantitatively informed qualitative assessment of the landscape's difficulty. It captures the challenge of deceptiveness in the landscape, which is something the K\/N ratio fails to do. However, it requires a priori knowledge of the global optimum. It also helps in classifying the type of fitness landscape, which aligns with the recent trend of classifying landscapes to identify the appropriate algorithm.\n\n"}

FINDINGS Of the 47 students initially enrolled, 12 opted-out of the leaderboard. There were no distinguishable differences between the users who opted-out and those who stayed. In order to test how students perceived the interactive elements [RQ.1], we looked at the student evaluations, and compared the 5 interactive element types. A Kruskal-Wallis test found a significant between-distributions difference. Thus, a Mann-Whitney U post hoc test was applied to determine which distributions differed from each other. This revealed that students found the multiple-choice tests (mean\u00bc4.4) significantly more rewarding than the simulations (M\u00bc3.4,z\u00bc\u22123.18,p\u00bc0.001) FIG. 2.

As one collaborator noted, \u201cCreating a proposal with a group of people you have never worked with before, and that has not yet gone through the typical phases of team development (forming - storming - norming - performing), seems challenging at the beginning. Doing so in an online context adds additional complexity.\u201d To overcome this challenge in the early stages of proposal development, participants emphasized that the facilitator played a critical role during the rapid prototyping of their proposal drafts at the conference. They valued the facilitator\u2019s capacity to structure and aggregate thoughts, particularly after the brainstorming session, and to transfer them into the proposal template. Facilitators may also be a particularly strong asset when granted authority by group members to act as de facto decision-makers. One of the most challenging decisions to be made in the groups, for example, was which inputs to keep for the proposal: \u201cWe collected all ideas as we aimed at coming up with as many aspects as possible.

HI is a subset of the overlap between Human Computation and AI. As HI can be achieved with only two agents, it lies partially outside of Collective Intelligence which requires at least three agents (Wooley et al. 2010). Apart from collectiveness and solution superiority, HI poses a rather strict requirement of mutual learning, which explains the substantial overlap between CS and AI as well as an overlap of AI and Human Computation beyond the area of HI. Since few projects today achieve all three HI requirements, the size of the HI field on fig 1 is overrepresented. However, HI\u2019s importance will likely accelerate as algorithmic development increasingly focuses on human-centered AI (Auernhammer 2020). For the rest of this paper, we focus on the overlap between CS (fig. 1, yellow box) and AI (fig. 1, purple box), and discuss the characteristics which make projects lie inside or outside the realm of HI.\n### Input: What is the relationship between Hybrid Intelligence, Citizen Science, and Artificial Intelligence in the context of mixed-agent computation and agent count as illustrated in Figure 1?\n### Response: Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is a subset of the overlap between Human Computation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It can be achieved with only two agents, which is why it lies partially outside of Collective Intelligence that requires at least three agents. HI also has a substantial overlap with Citizen Science (CS) and AI, as well as an overlap of AI and Human Computation beyond the area of HI. This is due to the strict requirement of mutual learning in HI. The overlap between CS and AI, and the characteristics that make projects lie inside or outside the realm of HI, are the focus of the paper.\n\n"}

Recently, policy-makers, funding agencies, and academic journals have increased their pressure on scientists to share their scientific data (Borgman 2012, European Commission 2020a,b, Nature 2021, Wiley 2021). Policy-makers expect that the emerging norm of open data sharing in science will promote various benefits, including enhanced reproducibility, resource efficiency, new research and innovation, and opportunities for collaboration (Pasquetto et al. 2017).  However, there seems to be a gap between such open data policies for authors and the actual accessibility of data in some fields (Zenk-M\u00f6ltgen et al. 2018). Furthermore, tension exists between what is expected from scientists and what they want (or are able) to do themselves (Fecher et al. 2015).\n### Input: What are the challenges and barriers faced by scientists in adhering to the open data sharing policies, and how do these impact the accessibility and reproducibility of scientific data?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific information on the challenges and barriers faced by scientists in adhering to the open data sharing policies, nor does it discuss how these impact the accessibility and reproducibility of scientific data.\n\n"}

Assembling people with different organisational roles or backgrounds, and who possess  a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise, helps teams unravel complex tasks related to  scientific knowledge production (Van Noorden 2015 ). Similarly, heterogeneous vocabul - aries, cognitive patterns, and styles can expose individuals to a greater variety of novel  ideas and lead to knowledge recombination (Fleming and Sorenson 2004 ; Gruber,  Harhoff, and Hoisl 2013 ). However, positive effects seem to diminish following an  inverse-U shape with increasing cognitive distance (Wuyts et al. 2005 ). Recent research  has set out to differentiate the effects of having individual team members with inter - disciplinary backgrounds (intra-personal diversity) or team members who are specialists  in different disciplines (inter-personal diversity) (Haeussler and Sauermann 2020 ).\n### Input: How does team diversity facilitate the application of OIS practices in scientific knowledge production?\n### Response: Team diversity facilitates the application of OIS practices in scientific knowledge production by assembling people with different organisational roles or backgrounds, and who possess a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise.

The algorithmic support of the scientific processes beyond data acquisition could seek inspiration within cutting edge AI trends such as unsupervised ML, hierarchical modeling (Menon et al., 2017) and generative design (McKnight, 2017; Oh et al., 2019). \n### Input: How can the concept of co-created Citizen Science be further enhanced by incorporating advanced AI trends such as unsupervised machine learning, hierarchical modeling, and generative design?\n### Response: The concept of co-created Citizen Science can be further enhanced by incorporating advanced AI trends such as unsupervised machine learning, hierarchical modeling, and generative design by providing algorithmic support to the scientific processes beyond data acquisition. These AI trends can help in hypothesis generation, design, and analysis. Unsupervised machine learning can help in identifying patterns and relationships in data that may not be apparent to human observers. Hierarchical modeling can help in structuring complex data in a way that makes it easier to understand and analyze. Generative design can help in creating new and innovative solutions to scientific problems.

Rafner et al. \/ Human Computation (2022) 9:1      working styles of the individual users in order to pursue maximally synergetic human-AI interfaces.  We argue that the field of CitSci is well-suited for developing integrated human-machine interactions for two distinct reasons. First, although many fields of science involve human problem-solving, the human computation being performed in science in general is often defined implicitly through the tacit domain-specific experience of the involved experts. In contrast, CitSci specializes in explicitly transforming conventional research challenges into tasks adapted to the problem-solving abilities and collective intelligence of the general public. Thus, we argue that CitSci provides a unique snapshot of the current human-machine problem solving boundary because CitSci projects remain active only as long as the core challenge is unachievable by other (computational) means.\n### Input: What makes the field of Citizen Science (CitSci) particularly suitable for developing integrated human-machine interactions?\n### Response: The field of Citizen Science (CitSci) is particularly suitable for developing integrated human-machine interactions for two reasons. Firstly, unlike many fields of science that implicitly define human computation through the tacit domain-specific experience of experts, CitSci explicitly transforms conventional research challenges into tasks adapted to the problem-solving abilities and collective intelligence of the general public.

This is done using the generator of a pre-trained StyleGAN2 [ 36], trained to produce images based on style and content. After completing a tutorial, users blend images by changing the slider values for the style and content of each of the images (Fig 1, left), taking content (large scale features) from some images, and blending them with the style (small scale features and texture) of other images. Users are presented with 4 source images that can be freely \u2018swapped\u2019 with alternative images. When users save an image, they label it as being either utopian, or dystopian. The image and the label are then stored in a database. There is also a publicly available galleryof all generated images (Fig 1, right). Users can download their own saved images and any images in the public gallery. In crea.blender SDG there are 102 source images, selected from the landscape category in Artbreeder. We deliberately chose source images with as great a variety as possible in terms of different motivic elements (water, buildings, mountains, etc.) as well as dif- ferent colors. We used the landscape GAN to avoid portraits and people due to concerns about relating utopian\/dystopian ratings to people\u2019s outer appearance [5].\n### Input: What is the purpose of the Crea.blender SDG and how does it function?\n### Response: The purpose of Crea.blender SDG is to allow users to blend two different components, 'style' and 'content', of a set of source images into new images. It functions using the generator of a pre-trained StyleGAN2, which is trained to produce images based on style and content. After a tutorial, users blend images by adjusting the slider values for the style and content of each image. They can take content from some images and blend them with the style of other images. Users are given 4 source images that can be swapped with alternative images. When an image is saved, users label it as either utopian or dystopian and the image and label are stored in a database.

It is widely recognized as a critical skill in today\u2019s fast-paced and unpredictable world [ 13]. The CPS process typically unfolds through distinct phases: understanding the problem space, generating alternative problem constructions (i.e., problem fram- ings), evaluating the quality of these constructions, and, ultimately, generating and implementing creative solutions [ 12]. Although the CPS literature primarily focuses on the evaluation, generation, and implementation of solutions, problem identification and construc- tion play a crucial role in the process. This is because the way a problem is framed has a significant impact on the solution process and its outcome [1]. \n### Input: What is the significance of problem identification and construction in the Creative Problem-Solving process?\n### Response: Problem identification and construction play a crucial role in the Creative Problem-Solving process because the way a problem is framed significantly impacts the solution process and its outcome.\n\n"}

Beck et al. research process, it can be challenging to meaningfully involve stigmatised individuals in co-creation (as seen in the \u201cOpen Research Behind Closed Doors\u201d project). Stigma from multiple sources, such as institutionalisation and intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, prevents marginalised actors from participating in research, exacerbating existing barriers such as language, power hierarchies, and access to technology. To address this challenge, our study takes a multimodal approach to involving institutionalised individuals and their families in research co-creation. Participatory mapping will be employed to explore the capabilities afforded and denied to research participants in an inclusive format that does not rely on written or spoken language. By going beyond accepted models of dialogue, this study will contribute novel insights into how stigmatised individuals can be engaged in vital research domains such as human rights and social innovation.\n### Input: What multimodal approach does the study propose to involve stigmatised individuals in research co-creation and how does it aim to overcome existing barriers such as language, power hierarchies, and access to technology?\n### Response: The study proposes to use participatory mapping as a multimodal approach to involve stigmatised individuals in research co-creation.

GANs traditionally consist of a generator, that is trained to generate images, and a discriminator, that is trained to distinguish between real images, and images created by the generator. Artists have recently started using just the trained generator to produce images. When used as a tool for artistic expression, one can feed an input vector into the generator and it will provide an image based on both the vector, and its internal state, i.e. its weights and biases. Importantly, while the internal state of the generator directly corresponds with the features of the generated image, these features do not necessarily align with the features that a human would perceive. For example, in a picture containing an orange ball and trees in the background, humans intending to enhance a distinct shape from an image (e.g. \u2018the orange ball\u2019) might have the frustrating experience that the system instead enhances some blurred trees in the background that the participant didn\u2019t even notice. The question of user control over GANs for image generation is thus fundamental in determining the systems feasibility for creative processes [ 17,24].\n### Input: What challenges might artists face when using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation in terms of user control and alignment with human perception?\n### Response: Artists might face challenges in terms of user control over GANs for image generation as the features of the generated image, which directly correspond with the internal state of the generator (its weights and biases), do not necessarily align with the features that a human would perceive. For instance, if a human intends to enhance a distinct shape from an image, the system might instead enhance a different feature that the user didn't even notice. This misalignment between the system's output and the user's intention can be frustrating and can limit the system's feasibility for creative processes.\n\n"}

Researchers and industry usually do not provide compensation (beyond sometimes remuneration for participation) for this involvement, as patients already typically feel rewarded by contributing to the improvement of therapies. However, with patients becoming more involved in the co-development and improvement of devices - often providing important insights, e.g., about product usability and design requirements and therefore leading to better products - questions have begun to arise as to whether and how their contributions should be rewarded.

Others approach the core concepts of quantum theory and the associated unique paradigm, highlighting the fascinating differences in how the world is understood in this \ufb01eld as compared to other areas of science, e.g., [ 75,76].\"\n### Input: What are the two approaches taken to outreach of the discipline-culture of quantum physics?\n### Response: The two approaches taken to outreach of the discipline-culture of quantum physics are: one, storytelling the applications of quantum technologies and linking them with their impact on society, such as through citizen science; and two, approaching the core concepts of quantum theory and the associated unique paradigm, highlighting the fascinating differences in how the world is understood in this field as compared to other areas of science.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: Out of the reviewed papers, only four games implemented progression (modal-, level-, or round- based)  explicitly in their design. This can be taken as an indication of the \u201cprototype\u201d level of many of the examined  games. The games without progression of any kind  simply presented the player with a task and ended either  when the task was completed or the time ran out (Hart  et al., 2017 ; Krebs et al., 2020 ; Rozenkrantz et al., 2017 ).  In contrast, Physics Playground (Shute & Rahimi, 2021 )  has an extensive standard playmode with level-based  progression, which scores creativity of the players  using stealth assessment. Additionally, it has a level editor mode, where participants can build their own levels,  which are scored by expert raters. Crea.blender (Rafner  et al., 2020 ) includes three modes, all with the same core  game mechanics (AI-enhanced image blending), but  different goals. Each of these modes are designed to  assess either DT, CT, or creative products. Similar to  Physics Playground, the \u2018creative products\u2019 mode is  envisioned to be assessed by human raters. Within the  CT mode, there are three levels, each increasing in  difficulty.\n### Input: What are some examples of games that have implemented progression in their design and how do they assess player creativity?\n### Response: The text mentions two games that have implemented progression in their design. The first one is Physics Playground, which uses level-based progression. It assesses player creativity through stealth assessment in its standard play mode. Additionally, it has a level editor mode where players can create their own levels, which are then scored by expert raters. The second game is Crea.blender, which includes three modes with the same core game mechanics but different goals. Each mode is designed to assess either divergent thinking (DT), convergent thinking (CT), or creative products. Similar to Physics Playground, the 'creative products' mode is assessed by human raters. Within the CT mode, there are three levels, each increasing in difficulty.\n\n"}

Allowing others to access and reuse data requires the originating scientist to consider the nature of the data, incentives, rewards, and ownership issues (Borgman 2012) when deciding what and how to share. Moreover, some types of data may not be relevant to others (e.g., Czarnitzki et al. 2015) and a lot of shared data is not used (Science 2011, Wallis 2013). There is also an increasing need for auxiliary metadata and tools, as data alone is not always valuable (Borgman 2012).

Thus, knowing how to differentiate is crucial for any student who wants to proceed with the higher levels of education in science. In order to obtain an intuition about the basic principles of differentiation, repeated practice in solving differentiation-problems is necessary. Students are, however, usually first introduced to the concepts through lectures where the math is presented in an abstract format. Earlier studies have shown an improved learning process by letting students first investigate and try to solve problems within a subject on their own before exposing them to the formal knowledge that enables novices to form an initial understanding of the subject (Kapur et al., 2010).\n### Input: What is the importance of understanding differentiation for students pursuing higher education in science, according to Mads Kock Pedersen et al.?\n### Response: According to Mads Kock Pedersen et al., understanding differentiation is crucial for students pursuing higher education in science.

Challenges and opportunities with artificial intelligence in biomedical research In a talk by Jennifer Couch, Branch Chief in the Division of Cancer Biology at NIH, we learned that recent technological advances have led to exciting and promising new applications of artificial intelligence in biomedical research. Still, there are a lot of challenges when applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research. For example, some AI tools used by researchers were not developed specifically for biomedical data, so their design is often missing key elements for a successful application. Another important challenge in this field is the limited interpretability of AI models. Being able to understand the decision making process of an intelligent algorithm is valuable in building trust and gaining novel biological insights.\n### Input: What are some of the challenges faced when applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research according to Jennifer Couch, Branch Chief in the Division of Cancer Biology at NIH?\n### Response: According to Jennifer Couch, some of the challenges faced when applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research include the fact that some AI tools used by researchers were not developed specifically for biomedical data, so their design often lacks key elements for successful application.

The first and perhaps most important of these emerges from the exposure that OIS scholars get to problems experienced by the end-users of their research. Despite - or maybe even as a result of - the fact that their research focuses on the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of openness and collaboration in science, use problems may sometimes go overlooked. Exposure to challenges faced by OIS users can thus shift the perceived importance of one\u2019s own research focus and inspire entirely new directions that persist well beyond the completion of the group proposal.\n### Input: What benefits can OIS scholars gain from exposure to the problems experienced by the end-users of their research?\n### Response: OIS scholars can gain significant benefits from exposure to the problems experienced by the end-users of their research.

Rafner Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark janetrafner@mgmt.au.dk ABSTRACT Digital games used to assess creativity represents an emerging but underexplored topic. These games could allow for the combination of scalability through crowdsourcing and potentially higher ecological testing using fine-grained data acquisition from more natural settings. This development could also provide a promising a testbed for exploring human-AI creativity. However, success both in the design and implementation phases hinges on the games being both valid instruments for measuring creativity as well as engaging enough for the general public to want to play. This paper presents my initial PhD work focused on designing CREA: a suite of freely accessible digital games and tasks to understand and assess creativity. First I describe the CREA games and tasks, then discuss my considerations and challenges for operationalizing creativity within the games, present initial participant feedback, and discuss future work.\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of using digital games like CREA to assess creativity, and what has been the initial participant feedback on this approach?\n### Response: The potential benefits of using digital games like CREA to assess creativity include scalability through crowdsourcing and potentially higher ecological testing using fine-grained data acquisition from more natural settings. It could also provide a promising testbed for exploring human-AI creativity. The challenges include ensuring the games are valid instruments for measuring creativity and making them engaging enough for the general public to want to play.

Taken at face value, this  could imply a failure to capture the essence of creativity.  However, the authors report similarly low correlations  among the variety of standard tests they employed in the  study. Therefore, it can be seen that the low correlations  of the game metrics with standard values could be taken  as an indication of limited construct validity of the  standard tasks, or, as Runco et al. (2016 ) suggest, as an  indication that different standard tests capture different  aspects of creativity. The largest validation study,  Physics Playground (N = 167; Shute & Rahimi, 2021 )  reports similarly low convergent validity with standard  tests (r = 0.18). BuzzWords (Howell & Veale, 2009 ),  Arctic Quest (Chuang et al., 2015 ), and Immune  Defense (Krebs et al., 2020 ) stand out with reports of  higher correlation values (r > 0.5). This could indicate  that these approaches should be particularly promising  for creativity assessment. However, such an interpreta - tion should be moderated by both the lack of correlation  among standardized measures, combined with the low  participant numbers observed (N < 30) in games report - ing high correlation. Given all the above, these values  may simply indicate that the game-based interaction has  been in fact, successfully implemented to match the  particular processes of the selected reference task rather  than capturing the general underlying phenomenon of  creativity. We therefore recommend that convergent  validity be used in combination with other complemen - tary validity measures (e.g., ecological and construct) in  order to more deeply understand creativity.\n### Input: What does the low correlation of game metrics with standard values indicate about the validity of standard tasks in assessing creativity?\n### Response: The low correlation of game metrics with standard values could indicate limited construct validity of the standard tasks in assessing creativity. This suggests that these standard tasks may not be accurately capturing the essence of creativity. Alternatively, as suggested by Runco et al. (2016), it could also indicate that different standard tests capture different aspects of creativity.\n\n"}

Incentive structures beyond the organisational level also have ramifications for the decisions that research organisations make about investing in openness and collaboration. For instance, while interdisciplinary research has more difficulty attracting external funding (Bromham, Dinnage, and Hua 2016 ; Banal-Esta\u00f1ol, Macho-Stadler, and P\u00e9rez-Castrillo 2019 ) it also generates more citations (Larivi\u00e8re, Haustein, and B\u00f6rner 2015 ) and confers institutional prestige (Torres-Olave et al. 2020 ), thus involving a high risk\/high reward trade-off for both academic scientists and organisations deciding whether to prioritise such research (Fortunato et al. 2018 ; Leahey, Beckman, and Stanko 2017 ).\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and risks for academic scientists and organisations when deciding to prioritise interdisciplinary research?\n### Response: The potential benefits of prioritising interdisciplinary research for academic scientists and organisations include generating more citations and conferring institutional prestige.

Lumsden,Skinner, Woods, Lawrence, and Munaf\u00f2 (2016) is an excellent example of this, where theGo\/No-Go task is gami\ufb01ed by adding wild west illustrations and framing the task as a game,where the villains should be shot and the innocent left alive. These game-like tasks have beenshown to be more engaging, at least according to players\u2019 self-report, compared to their moretraditional counterpart while producing similar results (Hawkins, Rae, Nesbitt, & Brown,2013).\n### Input: What is one example of a traditional cognitive ability task being gamified, and how does this approach impact player engagement and results?\n### Response: The text provides an example of a traditional cognitive ability task being gamified through the Go\/No-Go task. This task was gamified by adding wild west illustrations and framing the task as a game where the villains should be shot and the innocent left alive. This approach has been shown to increase player engagement, as per players' self-reports, compared to the traditional version of the task. Despite the added game-like elements, the gamified task still produces similar results to its traditional counterpart.\n\n"}

Tier 4 also satisfies all three components of HI. However, the OnSA contains an AI model that is trained and executed while individual participants interact with it, allowing for mutual learning of the human and AI agents in real time. The basic form of this scheme does not contain an OnSA, implying the absence of arrows f and g. To our knowledge, no CS project uses this type of scheme. Although, judging by its information flow diagram, it appears particularly simple, the presence of both training and execution in real time interaction with participants raises many practical and technical issues.\n### Input: What are the challenges of implementing Tier 4: Hybrid Intelligence at an individual level in a Citizen Science project?\n### Response: The text mentions that implementing Tier 4: Hybrid Intelligence at an individual level in a Citizen Science project raises many practical and technical issues.

From existing literature, we know that involving users of research can be worthwhile and even necessary, for instance in order to access key insights needed in the research process and to increase the likelihood of uptake and diffusion of outcomes (Olmos-Pe\u00f1uela et al. 2015, 2016).  A stream of research has focused on benefits and challenges of involving users in health and social care research (e.g. Wright et al. 2007, Barber et al. 2011, Domecq et al. 2014). Here users may be defined narrowly as patients or service users and their carers, or more broadly as possible patients, relevant community organizations and the like, health professionals, members of the general public, etc. (Wright et al. 2007). Benefits of user involvement include, e.g., increasing the range of research topics, focusing research on issues that are important to users, more effective dissemination of findings, an accelerated uptake of research, more effective and \u2018user-friendly\u2019 trials and interventions, and more use-informed interpretations of evidence (Trivedi & Wykes 2002, McLaughlin 2010, Barber et al. 2011). Effectively involving users in research processes is, however, no trivial task. Engaging users can raise a series of, e.g., legal, ethical, and practical issues which must be addressed by researchers (Beresford 2013). Others have pointed to the risk of user involvement in research taking on a tokenistic nature or being seen as a solution to all ailments (McLaughlin 2010). Moreover, involving users in research can challenge the autonomy of researchers and standard practices in the research process (Wright et al. 2007, Barber et al. 2011). Finally, there are also potential downsides for users, including for instance a risk of feeling exploited by the research process (McLaughlin 2010).\n### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of involving users in the research process, according to existing literature?\n### Response: According to existing literature, the potential benefits of involving users in the research process include increasing the range of research topics, focusing research on issues that are important to users, more effective dissemination of findings, an accelerated uptake of research, more effective and \u2018user-friendly\u2019 trials and interventions, and more use-informed interpretations of evidence. However, there are also challenges associated with this involvement. These include legal, ethical, and practical issues that must be addressed by researchers. There is also a risk of user involvement in research taking on a tokenistic nature or being seen as a solution to all problems.

Beck et al. 40 personal benefits from sharing\/collaboration (such as opportunities for permanent employment positions), they may also see greater costs and risks (such as greater career risk if competing teams make discoveries first). This led to the more general RQ3: How is seniority within the team (e.g., postdoc vs. team leader) related to perceived costs and benefits of sharing\/collaboration, and how does this shape attitudes towards sharing\/collaboration? Fig. 2 illustrates potential relationships between these constructs as the basis for future conceptual and empirical work.\n### Input: What is the relationship between a team member's seniority and their perception of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration, and how does this influence their attitudes towards these practices?\n### Response: The text suggests that a team member's seniority could be related to their perception of the costs and benefits of sharing and collaboration. However, the specific nature of this relationship is not detailed in the text. It is suggested that while senior team members might see personal benefits from sharing and collaboration, such as opportunities for permanent employment positions, they might also perceive greater costs and risks, such as a higher career risk if competing teams make discoveries first. This perception could shape their attitudes towards sharing and collaboration. However, further conceptual and empirical work is needed to fully understand these potential relationships.\n\n"}

Broadly, game-based assessment can be  described as \u201cusing data from in-game actions to make  inferences about players\u2019 knowledge, skills, and attributes,  allowing us to make use of information in the ocean of  data produced by daily digital interactions with software \u201d  (DiCerbo, 2014 , p. 26). In the context of creativity assess - ment, there are several factors which could allow for the  combination of scalability and refined data acquisition.  First, the gamified environment elicits behavior that is  more casual and natural than the completion of tradi - tional tests. This can mitigate unintended physiological  effects, such as test anxiety, or researcher effect and in  turn may result in data with higher ecological validity  (Lumsden, Edwards, Lawrence, Coyle, & Munaf\u00f2, 2016 ;  Shute & Kim, 2014 ). Digital games are also more motivat - ing to people than standardized tests are (Gee, 2005 ).  Intrinsic motivation can induce a \u2018flow state,\u2019 in which  people fully concentrate on and enjoy the task-at-hand.  This state can be achieved when people have clear goals,  immediate feedback, and a balance between challenges  and skills (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997 ). Being in the flow-  state also allows for creativity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997 ),  and thus creates a good opportunity for creativity  assessment.\n### Input: What are the advantages of using digital game-based assessments for evaluating creativity compared to traditional testing methods?\n### Response: The text mentions several advantages of using digital game-based assessments for evaluating creativity compared to traditional testing methods. Firstly, the gamified environment elicits more casual and natural behavior, which can reduce unintended physiological effects like test anxiety or researcher effect, resulting in data with higher ecological validity. Secondly, digital games are more motivating than standardized tests, which can induce a 'flow state' where people fully concentrate on and enjoy the task at hand. This state, which can be achieved when people have clear goals, immediate feedback, and a balance between challenges and skills, also allows for creativity, making it a good opportunity for creativity assessment. Lastly, game-based assessment allows for the use of data from in-game actions to make inferences about players' knowledge, skills, and attributes, providing a combination of scalability and refined data acquisition.\n\n"}

The potential of visualization in CPS has been demonstrated in design problem-solving [ 6,14], where sketching and other vi- sual aids facilitate multiple problem representations and creative solutions. However, the value of visualization for non-designers remains understudied, possibly due to the assumption that some level of design skills is necessary. Therefore, it is important to ex- plore alternative, non-domain-specific ways to empower and assist people to visualize ideas. \n### Input: What are some alternative, non-domain-specific ways to empower and assist people in visualizing ideas, especially for non-designers?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific examples of alternative, non-domain-specific ways to empower and assist people in visualizing ideas, especially for non-designers.\n\n"}

It is important to explore if differ- ent game-mode prompts in crea.blender can elicit different types of behavior as each mode is tied to specific creative processes. The primary interaction method in crea.blender is changing the weights of each image with the corresponding slider before generating a new image. Therefore, one approach is to look for systematic dif- ferences in the size of the changes to sliders players make in the different modes (Figure 6). DT is most commonly associated with an open, explorative process whereas CT is commonly associated with iterative narrowing in on a particular solution or idea [ 15]. Thus, in the Creatures mode (DT task), we expect much larger average step sizes when creating images than in the challenge mode (CT task) On average players generated 33.5 (SD=13), 86.25 (SD=29), and 43.38 (SD=11) images in the Creates, Challenge and Open Play modes respectively. Players\u2019 changes to sliders ranged from small (iterative) to large (explorative). Figure 6 shows the cumulative Figure 6 Cumulative histogram of slider changes for all play- ers in the different modes. fraction of total changes in sliders for players per image generated. For instance, 78% of images in the Challenge mode were generated with a change smaller than 0.2. In contrast, 79% and 66% of images respectively in the Creatures and Open Play modes were made with changes larger than 0.2. A Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.001) and post- hoc pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests revealed small but significant differences in behavior between the open play and creatures mode ( = 0.17, p<0.001) and much more dramatic differences between these and the challenge mode ( =0.66 and = 0.55, respectively, p<0.001). The latter confirms expectations from previous creativity research, whereas the former provides intriguing input to further work.\n### Input: What are the differences in player behavior between the open play and creatures mode in crea.blender, and how do these compare to the challenge mode?\n### Response: The text suggests that player behavior in crea.blender varies depending on the game mode. In the Creatures mode, which is associated with divergent thinking (DT), players tend to make larger changes to the image sliders, indicating a more open and explorative process. In contrast, the Challenge mode, associated with convergent thinking (CT), sees players making smaller changes to the sliders, suggesting an iterative process of narrowing down on a specific solution or idea. The Open Play mode seems to fall somewhere in between, with both small and large changes to sliders observed. Statistical tests revealed small but significant differences in behavior between the open play and creatures mode, and much more dramatic differences between these and the challenge mode.\n\n"}

Introduction Hybrid intelligence represents the collaboration of humans and machines, where artificial intelligence (AI) is augmenting human skills and creativity in order to achieve complex goals. Instead of replacing humans with AI, this technique leverages complementary strengths and learning reciprocity between humans and machines. As hybrid intelligence may take many forms, it was the topic of a recent workshop where people that are engaged in citizen science projects in various capacities have come together to model and innovate the design of hybrid intelligence systems. The teams were provided with a set of concepts to work with and had the liberty of representing an existing hybrid process or creating a new model, for example one that introduces hybrid intelligence to an existing crowdsourcing system. This report summarizes the workshop talks, activities, and outcomes.\n### Input: What is hybrid intelligence and how was it explored in a recent workshop involving citizen science projects?\n### Response: Hybrid intelligence is the collaboration of humans and machines, where artificial intelligence augments human skills and creativity to achieve complex goals. It leverages the complementary strengths and learning reciprocity between humans and machines. In a recent workshop involving citizen science projects, hybrid intelligence was explored by bringing together individuals engaged in various capacities. They were tasked with modeling and innovating the design of hybrid intelligence systems. The teams were given a set of concepts to work with and could either represent an existing hybrid process or create a new model, such as introducing hybrid intelligence to an existing crowdsourcing system.\n\n"}

To minimize confusion, we built a separate \ufb02owscene for each of the two scenarios, the latter of which is shown and described brie\ufb02y in Fig. 1. The \ufb01rst scenario used a Predict, Explore, Revise framework. Here, students were asked to Predict (using either words, equations, or sketches, but without using Composer) how the system is represented statically or will behave under time evolution, depending on the part of the exercise they are working with. Afterwards, they would use Composer to Explore the relevant aspect of the exercise and use their explorations to Revise their understanding. These key words were also used in the second scenario, but, as the participants had not seen the double-well potential before, this part of the exercise started with exploration of the system behavior (cf. the \ufb01rst two points in the list above) before asking students to use the Predict, Explore, Revise framework for the last two points.\n### Input: What is the Predict, Explore, Revise framework used in the first scenario of the interviews?\n### Response: The Predict, Explore, Revise framework used in the first scenario of the interviews involves students predicting how the system is represented statically or will behave under time evolution, depending on the part of the exercise they are working with.

This aligns well  with how construct validity is inferred from gradually  accumulated data by a diversity of approaches (Messick,  1987 ). Taking the recommendation for multiple tasks  one step further, if properly managed, robust data sets  from suites of games could glean vastly more information on the complex process of creativity than any one  individual game or task alone. For instance, crea.blender  belongs to a suite of games that has been designed in  response to the call for portfolio-based assessment of  creativity (Rafner, 2021 ; Rafner et al., 2020 ). A major  challenge for such a suite would be ensuring sufficient  engagement and motivation so that it does not induce  testing fatigue and player disengagement (Lieberoth,  Pedersen, & Sherson, 2015 ).\n### Input: What are the challenges in ensuring sufficient engagement and motivation in a suite of games designed for portfolio-based assessment of creativity?\n### Response: The challenges in ensuring sufficient engagement and motivation in a suite of games designed for portfolio-based assessment of creativity include preventing testing fatigue and player disengagement.\n\n"}

Landscape Ruggedness: Modality and Locality Measures. We have addressed the pitfalls of using Kor K\/N ratios as measures of landscape ruggedness (the common approach in the social sciences) as well as identifying features that can impede any classifications of ruggedness. While it is clear that K influences how an agent is to search a given landscape, it is not clear how much epistasis \u201cis needed to make a problem difficult\u201d [62]. WZ_hus, we present a number of alternative approaches to capture landscape ruggedness. In computer science, a frequently used measure of landscape ruggedness is the number of local maxima or the modality of a landscape. WZ_he modality of a given landscape is often computed relative to the size of the fitness landscape: the higher the density of such local optima, the more complex the problem, i.e., the higher the likelihood that a solver will be stuck and unable to find the optimal solution. Note that the definition of a distance metric (and implicitly the neighborhood function) affects the number of local optima, since, by definition, for a problem (X, f) and a neighborhood function M, a solution x \u2217 is called locally optimal with respect to M, iff (x) \u2264 f x \u2217 \udbff\udf01, x \u2208 M(x).

(c) Deceptive landscape. (d) Neutral Landscape. 4 Complexity.\n### Input: What is the modality of a landscape in computer science and how does it affect the complexity of a problem?\n### Response: In computer science, the modality of a landscape refers to the number of local maxima. It is often computed relative to the size of the fitness landscape. The complexity of a problem is affected by the modality in that the higher the density of local optima, the more complex the problem becomes. This is because a higher density of local optima increases the likelihood that a solver will get stuck and be unable to find the optimal solution.\n\n"}

Scientific research often benefits from CS in ways that go beyond \u201cfree\u201d labor. For example, researchers use CS when they are unable to collect the necessary data by themselves (Wyler et al. 2016), need specific expertise from the general public to help solve a problem (Danielsen et al. 2018), datasets are too large or complicated for the researchers to process with their given technology and resources (Das et al. 2019, Fortson et al. 2011, Nugent, 2019), or the degrees of freedom of a system results in nearly infinite possible candidate solutions to be explored (Jensen et al. 2021, Koepnick et al. 2019). Simply put, CS projects enhance scientific research by tapping into the collective cognitive and labor resources of the general public.\n### Input: What are some of the reasons researchers might use citizen science (CS) in their work, according to various studies?\n### Response: According to various studies, researchers might use citizen science (CS) in their work when they are unable to collect the necessary data by themselves, when they need specific expertise from the general public to help solve a problem, when datasets are too large or complicated for the researchers to process with their given technology and resources, or when the degrees of freedom of a system results in nearly infinite possible candidate solutions to be explored.\n\n"}

Perhaps the best-known  legislative vehicle for this agenda was the Bayh-Dole Act, adopted in the United States in  1980. Before the Act\u2019s passage, inventions resulting from federal research funding were  assigned to the federal government; after its passage, though, universities were permitted  to retain ownership of an invention and, in the event of its commercialisation, the  associated revenues (Stevens 2004 ). The consequences of this legislation included an  increase in patenting and licencing activities at elite universities as well as at universities  that were previously inactive in the area of knowledge transfer, while raising concerns  about a shift away from basic research towards applied questions (Mowery et al. 2001 ).  Parallel legislation adopted in Europe proved to be less effective. The main reasons were  found to be lack of adequate internal support mechanisms, the often embryonic nature of  technology transfer offices, and the absence of patenting incentives (Grimaldi et al. 2011 ).  Thus, vesting ownership of inventions in universities is no longer considered optimal.  Indeed, there is renewed interest in revisiting the system of \u2018professor\u2019s privilege\u2019 that  these reforms were intended to replace (e.g. Ejermo and Toivanen 2018 ).\n### Input: What were the consequences of the Bayh-Dole Act and why was similar legislation less effective in Europe?\n### Response: The Bayh-Dole Act led to an increase in patenting and licensing activities at both elite and previously inactive universities in the area of knowledge transfer. However, it also raised concerns about a shift from basic research towards applied questions. Similar legislation in Europe was less effective due to a lack of adequate internal support mechanisms, the often embryonic nature of technology transfer offices, and the absence of patenting incentives.\n\n"}

Previous research suggests that creativity and various aspects of general intelligence, including abstract reasoning are in fact correlated [ 27].logic is built with items from the matrix reasoning item bank (MaRs-IB), Figure 4: logic : An example of a simple matrix with only one relational change: color (right). An example of a complex item containing more relational changes: position, color and shape (left). which contains 80 sets of items in total [ 25]. MaRs-IB was created to potentially serve as a free alternative to the classical abstract reasoning test, the Raven Progressive Matrices [ 26]. Players are presented with three-by-three matrices containing abstract shapes in each cell except for one, and they have to choose the missing one by figuring out the relationships across the provided shapes The items can vary in colour, size, position and shape and the combination of these, and the matrices vary in difficulty based on the amount of dimensions changing. Players have 8 minutes to solve as many puzzles as they can.\n### Input: What is the purpose of the logic tool in assessing abstract reasoning and how is it related to human cognitive functions?\n### Response: The purpose of the logic tool in assessing abstract reasoning is to evaluate one's ability to solve a task without primary knowledge. It serves as a base mechanism of human learning. It is related to human cognitive functions as it involves processing speed and working memory.\n\n"}

As these problems increase in complexity, they demand more creative  solutions, highlighting the need for open and collaborative practices that involve non-  scientific actors such as citizens, companies, and policymakers, as well as scientists from  a range of institutions and disciplinary backgrounds (Jones, Wuchty, and Uzzi 2008 ; Van  Noorden 2015 ; Ledford 2015 ). \n### Input: What is the importance of open and collaborative practices involving non-scientific actors in solving complex societal, technical, and environmental challenges?\n### Response: The text suggests that the importance of open and collaborative practices involving non-scientific actors in solving complex societal, technical, and environmental challenges lies in the need for more creative solutions. As these problems increase in complexity, they require a diverse range of perspectives and expertise. Involving citizens, companies, policymakers, and scientists from various institutions and disciplines can potentially lead to more innovative and effective solutions.\n\n"}

In order to address our first research question, we propose conducting multiple case studies in different settings with various stakeholders, including patients and patient organizations, company representatives, hospital personnel, and scientists. Via observations and interviews, we want to identify how value is distributed between the different actors and how they capture value under different conditions in different contexts. Building on the findings from the case studies and in order to shed more light on our second research question aiming to identify under which conditions individuals engage in sharing behaviour, we propose an experimental research design. Thereby we can test the effects of different conditions - e.g., increased transparency - on the data sharing behaviour of patients and the willingness of companies to make more ethical decisions and share more of their returns with patients. Moreover, scenario-based experiments could be helpful in order to elucidate the conditions under which patients would be willing to share their data. Answers to the descriptive and explanatory research questions will then also inform considerations regarding the normative aspects of patient data sharing. For example, we might gain insights into how the opportunistic behavior of companies vis-\u00e0-vis patients can be avoided and what the \u201cright\u201d model of value distribution should be. Moreover, we might learn what considerations of fairness should be made with respect to who benefits from the research. \n### Input: What research methods can be used to understand the distribution of value in patient data sharing and under what conditions individuals are willing to engage in this behavior?\n### Response: The research methods that can be used to understand the distribution of value in patient data sharing and under what conditions individuals are willing to engage in this behavior include conducting multiple case studies in different settings with various stakeholders and an experimental research design. The case studies would involve observations and interviews to identify how value is distributed between different actors and how they capture value under different conditions. The experimental research design would test the effects of different conditions on the data sharing behavior of patients and the willingness of companies to make more ethical decisions. Scenario-based experiments could also be used to elucidate the conditions under which patients would be willing to share their data.\n\n"}

Patenting entails the creation of a legal framework whereby \u2018the patented invention can normally only be exploited [. . .] with the authorisation of the owner of the patent\u2019 (World Intellectual Property Organization 2004 ). Giving such an authorisation to another actor, usually in exchange for money, constitutes a licencing process. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of patents taken out by academic scientists and research organisations (Lissoni et al. 2008 ). However, the effectiveness of university patenting and licencing as a vehicle for technology transfer is influenced by other, more informal mechanisms such as direct interactions. Openness, seen here as the leakage of knowledge, can also impede patent - ability because of the novelty requirement embedded in the patenting process (P\u00e9nin and Burger-Helmchen 2011 ).\n### Input: What factors influence the effectiveness of university patenting and licensing as a vehicle for technology transfer?\n### Response: The effectiveness of university patenting and licensing as a vehicle for technology transfer is influenced by factors such as direct interactions and other informal mechanisms.

In biology, the empirical evidence towards the existence of multimodal landscapes with numerous epistatic interactions continues to increase [41] and in cultural evolution there is also an ongoing discussion about the degree to which the biological world resembles NK landscapes [12]. Ganco [23] and Fleming and Sorenson [67] relied on patent analysis to empirically investigate if the NK model matches the fitness landscape of organizational outcomes. Yet, they reach different conclusions and we would argue that investigating if and when organizational landscapes might be deceptive or neutral would be a relevant avenue for future research. For example, neutrality can be argued to be generated by discretization. That is, while the contributions for the overall fitness can in principle be real numbers and thus infinite possibilities exist, one could argue that not all differences are of consequence, and therefore at some level of sensitivity some local peaks are indistinguishable from the global peak [59]. Neutrality can also be generated by probabilistic draws, where some combinations are nonviable, and therefore the landscape would be less of a Mount Fuji and rather resemble a maze of narrow ridges traversing a landscape of treacherous valleys [57]. Both these distinct mechanisms can arguably be seen at play in different organizational settings. The case for the first one can be made, since some organizational choices (e.g., hiring, promotions, etc.) do not have a visible and immediate impact on performance. However, as argued by [31], these neutral choices accumulate and do Complexity 7.\n### Input: What empirical evidence is there to support the existence of multimodal landscapes with numerous epistatic interactions in biology and cultural evolution?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific empirical evidence to support the existence of multimodal landscapes with numerous epistatic interactions in biology and cultural evolution.

These technologies, including platforms like DALL-E 2 [19] and Midjourney 2 [16], of- fer accessible and high-quality image generation capabilities that can potentially enhance problem identification and construction in CPS. These technologies create an opportunity to investigate the central research question of this article: to what extent does AI-assisted image generation serve as a resource for problem identification and construction in the CPS process? This study aims to contribute to CPS literature by addressing this question through crea.visions Paris, a human-AI co-creative tech- nology that combines a GAN and stable diffusion model to support AI-assisted image generation. We present initial findings from an in-the-wild experiment in which participants utilized crea.visions to aid problem construction during CPS. By analyzing these re- sults through thematic coding, we discuss the implications of these preliminary findings and their potential impact on the field. Our contribution to CPS research lies in investigating the potential of new assistive technology during the problem construction and identification phase to augment the problem-solving process.\n### Input: What is the central research question of the study conducted by Janet Rafner et al. regarding the role of AI-assisted image generation in problem identification and construction in the CPS process?\n### Response: The central research question of the study conducted by Janet Rafner et al. is: to what extent does AI-assisted image generation serve as a resource for problem identification and construction in the CPS process?\n\n"}

In what follows, we discuss each of these elements of the OIS Research Framework, moving from OIS practices (section 2.1.) and antecedents and boundary conditions (section 2.2.) to OIS-based outcomes and impacts (section 2.3.). \n### Input: What are the elements of the OIS Research Framework and how do they contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems?\n### Response: The text mentions three elements of the OIS (Open Innovation Science) Research Framework: OIS practices, antecedents and boundary conditions, and OIS-based outcomes and impacts. \n\n1. OIS Practices: These are the methods and approaches used in open innovation science. They could contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems by providing a platform for open collaboration and knowledge sharing. This could lead to the discovery of new research areas or highlight the need for more research in certain areas.\n\n2. Antecedents and Boundary Conditions: These refer to the factors that influence the implementation and success of OIS practices. Understanding these conditions can help in identifying areas where there is a lack of research or where certain societal problems are not being adequately addressed. This can then lead to these areas being prioritized for further research.\n\n3. OIS-based Outcomes and Impacts: These are the results and effects of implementing OIS practices. By evaluating these outcomes and impacts, researchers can identify which areas of science and society are benefiting from OIS and which are not. This can help in identifying under-researched areas and prioritizing them for future research.\n\nIn summary, the elements of the OIS Research Framework contribute to the identification and prioritization of under-researched scientific and societal problems by providing a structure for open collaboration, understanding the factors that influence research, and evaluating the outcomes of research practices.\n\n"}

For example, research shows that motivations for participating in a citizen science  project include learning new things, concern for others, self-improvement, social motiva - tion, and expected benefits for future careers (West and Pateman 2016 ; Tinati et al. 2017 ).  However, these motivations can vary depending on the intensity and maturity of a citizen\u2019s  involvement, in conjunction with other factors like professionalism (F\u00fcller et al. 2017 ). The  complex relationships between motivation, willingness, and capabilities clearly have effects  not only for citizen science, but for any OIS practice that relies on actors from outside of  academia. This highlights the importance of understanding self-selection into these roles so  as to ensure fit with evolving task requirements. \n### Input: What are the micro-level antecedents and contingencies that influence public engagement in science and how do factors like motivation, willingness, and capabilities affect participation in citizen science projects?\n### Response: The text suggests that micro-level antecedents and contingencies that influence public engagement in science include motivations such as learning new things, concern for others, self-improvement, social motivation, and expected benefits for future careers.

Three studies designed their experiment around  preexisting, commercially developed games (Chuang  et al., 2015 ; Gal et al., 2017 ; Voiskounsky et al., 2017 ),  while all other studies used games that had been designed  for academic purposes. The core game play interactions  varied from sandbox games such as Minecraft  (Voiskounsky et al., 2017 ) through image blending with  neural networks (Rafner et al., 2020 ), to educational games  focused on Newtonian physics (Shute & Rahimi, 2021 ). The games also differed in their inclusion of various  levels of difficulty, progression, multiple rounds, or mul- tiple modes of play. Here, a \u2018mode of play\u2019 refers to  different types of tasks within a game, while \u2018rounds\u2019  refer to the number of times a participant completes the  same type of task (no varying difficulty) and levels refers  to similar tasks with increasing difficulty. For example,  crea.blender (Rafner et al., 2020 ) includes three modes,  Create, Challenge and Open Play, all of which are dif- ferent types of tasks with same core game play, image  blending with a neural network. In contrast, the  reviewed study on Minecraft (Voiskounsky et al., 2017 )  consists of two rounds of a single mode, with partici - pants instructed to build two objects, a house and a ship,  which can be considered to require the same competen - cies. Overall, four games implemented progression  explicitly in their design, out of which, three worked  with level-based, and one with time-based progression.\n### Input: What does the term 'mode of play' refer to in the context of game design and how does it differ from 'rounds' and 'levels'?\n### Response: In the context of game design, the term 'mode of play' refers to different types of tasks within a game. It differs from 'rounds' and 'levels' in that 'rounds' refer to the number of times a participant completes the same type of task without varying difficulty, while 'levels' refer to similar tasks with increasing difficulty.\n\n"}

Hybrid intelligence In a talk by Jacob Sherson, Director of the Center for Hybrid Intelligence at Aarhus University, we were presented with the current state of AI development in the industry and were introduced to the concept of hybrid intelligence. Although machine learning models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in the lab, they often fail in real world settings. According to a study performed by [3], there are many obstacles when trying to integrate AI in organizations and 70% of AI projects generate little impact. There are also risks posed by AI operating autonomously, with humans out of the loop. Bias in the training data could lead to bias amplification, relying on AI to.\n### Input: What are some of the challenges and risks associated with integrating AI in organizations, as discussed by Jacob Sherson, Director of the Center for Hybrid Intelligence at Aarhus University?\n### Response: The challenges associated with integrating AI in organizations, as discussed by Jacob Sherson, include the fact that machine learning models, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance in labs, often fail in real-world settings. A study cited in his talk found that 70% of AI projects generate little impact when integrated into organizations.

The chosen AI assistance scheme should be carefully considered, taking into account the character and amount of data as well as the AI methodology applicable to the task. For example in Supervised Learning tasks such as in iNaturalist (iNaturalist 2021), Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al. 2008), Stall Catchers (Nugent 2019) and EyeWire (Kim et al. 2014), strong individual participant effects on the model are not desirable, as this can introduce large decision biases.\n### Input: What factors should be considered when choosing an AI assistance scheme for a specific task or scenario?\n### Response: The factors that should be considered when choosing an AI assistance scheme for a specific task or scenario include the character and amount of data, the AI methodology applicable to the task, and the potential for individual participant effects on the model, which could introduce large decision biases.\n\n"}

For example, gamified environments capture more casual and natural behavior than traditional tests, potentially mitigating unintended physiological effects, such as test anxiety, or researcher effect. Digital games also afford the ability to capture detailed, fine-grained steps in an individual\u2019s trajectory towards an output [ 11]. Given their accessibility, appeal and prevalence in peoples\u2019 everyday lives [ 30], digital games could allow for broader sampling (engaging many demographic groups), possibly leading to reliable predictions at the individual level (through validation of demographically fine-grained models). Digital games are more motivating than standardized tests [ 19]. Intrinsic motivation can induce a \u2018flow state\u2019 enhancing concentration on the task-at-hand. This state can be achieved when people have clear goals, immediate feedback, and a balance between challenges and skills [ 31]. Being in the flow-state fosters creativity [ 31], affording a great opportunity for assessment. Additionally, digital games enable higher engagement levels, allowing for longer interactions and multifaceted testing. This is necessary to elicit and assess both creative processes and products, without inducing testing fatigue especially when responding to a recent call for the adoption of comprehensive portfolio-based approaches in creativity assessment [ 20].\n### Input: What are the benefits of using game-based creativity assessment over traditional tests?\n### Response: The benefits of using game-based creativity assessment over traditional tests include capturing more casual and natural behavior, potentially reducing test anxiety or researcher effect.

Possible reasons for this finding include  differences in available time, industry experience, risk affinity, career pressure for  young scientists, network size, and environmental and institutional support (Abreu  and Grinevich 2013 ; Burns, O\u2019Connor, and Stocklmayer 2003 ; Ding, Murray, and  Stuart 2006 ; Stephan and El-Ganainy 2007 ). Gender differences in collaboration activity  can, however, be tempered by contextual factors, such as the presence of other women in  the work environment and institutional support for the careers of female scientists  (Tartari and Salter 2015 ). Elsewhere, it has also been argued that age is inversely related  to research productivity and the acceptance of new ideas, with older researchers tending  to be less active, more sceptical about patenting, and more closed-minded (Davis, Larsen,  and Lotz 2011 ; Stephan 1996 ).\n### Input: What factors might explain why older and male researchers are more likely to engage in open and collaborative practices?\n### Response: The text suggests that the factors that might explain why older and male researchers are more likely to engage in open and collaborative practices include differences in available time, industry experience, risk affinity, career pressure for young scientists, network size, and environmental and institutional support.\n\n"}

(Intermediary) outcomes of OIS practices along the entire scientific research  and dissemination process The outcomes of applying OIS practices can be located in traditional scientific outputs  such as peer-reviewed publications, as well as in a range of other knowledge objects not  previously considered research outputs in their own right. The growing prevalence of  open and collaborative practices thus exposes the limits of traditional scientometrics,  with its focus on citation counts and networks (Mingers and Leydesdorff 2015 ). Defining  and tracking these new outputs, assessing their quality, and allowing their creators to  capture value from them, pose significant challenges (Beck et al. 2019 ; Bornmann 2013 ).  While efforts to track and codify more diverse scientific activities are underway (e.g. pre-  registration platforms, peer review crediting schemes like Publons), open and collabora - tive practices are rarely, if ever, rewarded. Likewise, when relational outcomes are  considered, they are often limited to training and sustaining narrow research commu - nities rather than encompassing the formation of dialogic relationships across disciplines  and sectors of society (Phillips 2011 ).\n### Input: What are the challenges associated with defining, tracking, and assessing the quality of new outputs resulting from open and collaborative scientific practices?\n### Response: The challenges associated with defining, tracking, and assessing the quality of new outputs resulting from open and collaborative scientific practices include tracking and codifying more diverse scientific activities, assessing their quality, and allowing their creators to capture value from them.

Reshuffling proofs.\u2014Since the course exam was oral, the ability to understand and explicitly express the logical and domain-specific reasoning at each step of a proof was essential to performance. To train these abilities we created an interactive module which provided all the steps of a proof in random order (Fig.2). Students then had to give the correct sequence of the derivation.

Individual-level antecedents and boundary conditions First, we introduce individual-level antecedents and boundary conditions for applying OIS practices. The individual level comprises all \u2018human factors\u2019 related to individual persons, including attitudes, capabilities, skills, and prior experiences. Research has suggested that individual-level factors may be more important than organisation-level characteristics in studying openness and collaboration in science (Perkmann et al. 2013 ). The rationale for this is that universities can be described as professional bureaucracies (Mintzberg 1993 ) whose members largely decide which activities to participate in (D\u2019Este and Perkmann 2011 ). While research and teaching activities are mandatory for most academic scientists, industry- and impact-oriented activities are typically optional and a matter of personal choice (Azagra-Caro 2007 ; Lee 2000 ; Thursby and Thursby 2004 ). Even as these expectations begin to shift, whether scientists are able and willing to apply open and collaborative practices is likely to be influenced directly or indirectly by their individual-level factors.\n### Input: What are the individual-level antecedents and boundary conditions for applying Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices?\n### Response: The individual-level antecedents and boundary conditions for applying Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices include all 'human factors' related to individual persons. These factors encompass attitudes, capabilities, skills, and prior experiences. The willingness and ability of scientists to apply open and collaborative practices are likely influenced directly or indirectly by these individual-level factors.\n\n"}

Technologies of openness and collaboration. Scholars of science have paid  increasing attention to the role of specialised instruments in the production of scientific  knowledge, many of which were developed in and became strongly associated with  particular disciplinary communities (e.g. Lenoir and Lecuyer 1997 ). As interdisciplinary  problems and research teams come to the fore, though, previously domainspecific  technologies are being adopted by scientists across fields. This diffusion has facilitated  the distributed application of OIS practices. \n### Input: What role do specialized instruments play in the production of scientific knowledge and how has their adoption across various fields facilitated the application of Open Innovation Science practices?\n### Response: Specialized instruments play a crucial role in the production of scientific knowledge as they are often developed within and become strongly associated with specific disciplinary communities. Their adoption across various fields, particularly as interdisciplinary problems and research teams become more prevalent, has facilitated the application of Open Innovation Science (OIS) practices. This is because the diffusion of these domain-specific technologies allows for a more distributed application of OIS practices, enabling collaboration and openness across different scientific fields.\n\n"}

Nature 2018, Arnott et al. 2020, Chambers et al. 2021). As part of the SPOMAN Open Science initiative at Aarhus University (https:\/\/spoman-os.org), for example, real-world problems and the needs of industrial enterprises have been collaboratively translated into fundamental research questions and related projects in the material sciences. But the potential gains of the co-production approach come along with high costs and failure rates (e.g., Gulati et al. 2012, Shrum et al. 2001), requiring an improved understanding of processes for and contingencies in successfully co-producing scientific research. \n### Input: What are the potential benefits and challenges of the co-production approach in scientific research, as exemplified by the SPOMAN Open Science initiative at Aarhus University?\n### Response: The potential benefits of the co-production approach in scientific research, as exemplified by the SPOMAN Open Science initiative at Aarhus University, include the ability to collaboratively translate real-world problems and the needs of industrial enterprises into fundamental research questions and related projects. This approach emphasizes the importance of engaging with the users of scientific research on equal footing to co-produce research, which can lead to more relevant and applicable research outcomes. \n\nHowever, the text also mentions that this approach comes with high costs and failure rates. This suggests that the co-production approach may require significant resources and may not always lead to successful outcomes. It also implies that there may be challenges in managing the collaborative process and in aligning the interests and objectives of different stakeholders. Therefore, an improved understanding of processes for and contingencies in successfully co-producing scientific research is needed.\n\n"}

Using BigGAN [ 4], which has been trained on ImageNET [ 9], and by providing sets of between 3-6 source images, players can easily create a large number of new images bysimply adjusting how much of each source image will be blended in.crea.blender takes inspiration from one of the core aspects of creativity, constraint-based combinational creativity, which is here conceived visually as a means to achieve a creative outcome [6]. Having been trained on ImageNET, our neural network provides 1,000 different \"classes\" of objects, like cats, dogs, yachts, and people. By combining these, and adding a \"noise vector\" consisting of 128 floating point numbers, it is possible to produce billions and billions of different pictures, ranging from photo realistic to the macabre. While the generative range is limited by the training set, we believed this large combinatorial space would still sufficiently provide users with a feeling of creative freedom. Figure 1 Illustration of crea.blender\u2019s mechanics When mix- ing images in crea.blender, players use sliders to indicate how much they want each image to contribute to the generated image. A vector is calculated from these weights and the underlying vector of each respective source image. This new vector is then passed into the GAN. Above we illustrate how two source images can produce two relatively differently looking images, depending on which is weighted higher.\n### Input: What is the role of the \"noise vector\" in the crea.blender tool and how does it contribute to the generation of new images?\n### Response: The \"noise vector\" in the crea.blender tool is a set of 128 floating point numbers that is added to the combination of different \"classes\" of objects. It plays a crucial role in the generation of new images by introducing variability and randomness, thereby expanding the range of possible outcomes. This allows the tool to produce billions of different pictures, from photo realistic to the macabre, contributing to the feeling of creative freedom for the users.\n\n"}

The first of these is Reinforcement , which was coded when students noted an agreement between the results of working with Composer and their predictions in the Predict phase. In contrast, the Recollection and Discovery Outcomes were coded when students made incorrect predictions. The difference between these is that during Recollection , the students state that they recalled the correct relevant physics concepts from their previous knowledge (often gained from the course). We coded Discovery when students encountered a contradiction to their prediction and had to revise their understanding. For example, Interviewee 2 (I2) incorrectly predicted the shape of the imaginary part of the wavefunction (a common mistake made by students [13]) and had to revise their thinking when confronted with Composer visualizations. In addition, when students demonstrated evidence of new conceptual or mathematical understanding, this was also coded as Discovery . This arose, e.g., when students were exploring the unfamiliar double-well system.\n### Input: What are the three Outcomes coded during the Explore\/Revise segments in the study and how are they differentiated?\n### Response: The three Outcomes coded during the Explore\/Revise segments in the study are Reinforcement, Recollection, and Discovery.

Although the points and badges did not directly influence the students' grades, they were framed as part of the course material in preparation for the oral exam, thereby encouraging students to engage more with the curriculum. The leaderboard displaying high scores further added an element of competition, potentially motivating students to participate more actively.\n\n"}

Researchers and industry usually do not provide compensation (beyond remuneration for participation) for this involvement, as patients already typically feel rewarded by contributing to the improvement in therapy. But with patients getting more involved in the development and improvement of devices, often providing important insights into product usability and design requirements and therefore leading to better products, questions have begun to arise as to whether and how their contribution should be rewarded.\n### Input: Should patients be rewarded for their contribution to the development and improvement of medical devices, given their significant input into product usability and design requirements?\n### Response: The text does not provide a definitive answer to whether patients should be rewarded for their contribution to the development and improvement of medical devices.\n\n"}

To obtain estimates of the out -of-sample prediction strengths, we applied repeated cross - validation41 and used an elastic -net to avoid overfitting by performing variable selection and mitigating multicollinearity42. The process resulted in nine accepted prediction models with medium to strong effect sizes (Fig. 3a) and five rejected models; four were rejected because the model collapsed to the mean value (Fig. 3c), and one because of ceiling and discretisation effects of the task measure. Although it is possible that more advanced modelling of the existing data set can improve these results, the nine accepted models already represent a broad, strong, and rapid testing battery, ready for application.\n### Input: What methods were used to validate the cognitive ability measures from the games and what were the results of this process?\n### Response: The methods used to validate the cognitive ability measures from the games included training a linear model to predict cognitive abilities from game indicators, applying repeated cross-validation to obtain estimates of the out-of-sample prediction strengths, and using an elastic-net to avoid overfitting by performing variable selection and mitigating multicollinearity.

During initial coding, we found that exploration and revision often happened without a clear delineation between the two cases, so these were coded together. In addition, we coded for which Concepts that served to distinguish which physical concepts the exercise was asking the students to reason about. These codes distinguished between exploration of time-independent and time-dependent systems, single-eigenstate and superposition systems, and single- vs. double-well systems. This was coded simply to determine how much time students were spending working with which aspects of the exercise. Typically, multiple Concepts were coded simultaneously.\n### Input: What was the purpose of coding for the Concepts in the Predict, Explore, Revise framework?\n### Response: The purpose of coding for the Concepts in the Predict, Explore, Revise framework was to distinguish which physical concepts the exercise was asking the students to reason about.

First, by taking an interdisciplinary, collaborative  approach (see Appendix A for a detailed description), we bridge disciplinary differences  in terms of underlying norms, theories, assumptions, methods, and languages. While  open and collaborative practices are discussed in multiple scientific fields, an overall  understanding of antecedents, contingencies, and consequences has been missing, in part  due to these very real differences. Adding to the science of science literature (Brown,  Deletic, and Wong 2015 ; Dasgupta and David 1994 ; Fortunato et al. 2018 ; Jones, Wuchty,  and Uzzi 2008 ; Van Noorden 2015 ; Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007 ), we argue that a more  complete understanding of the available knowledge is needed to manage processes of  openness and collaboration in science. The co-creative approach we took to gathering  and structuring this knowledge, which granted all participants equal decision rights,  made it possible to aggregate knowledge of the scientific community about open and  collaborative research practices, so as to avoid redundancies in future scientific efforts  and to build a solid foundation for an ambitious research agenda. Our collaborative  approach will hopefully inspire future interdisciplinary endeavours.\n### Input: What are the three significant contributions of the OIS Research Framework and this article in understanding open and collaborative practices in science?\n### Response: The text mentions three significant contributions of the OIS Research Framework and this article in understanding open and collaborative practices in science. First, they bridge disciplinary differences in terms of norms, theories, assumptions, methods, and languages through an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach. Second, they provide a more complete understanding of the available knowledge needed to manage processes of openness and collaboration in science, adding to the science of science literature. Third, they aggregate knowledge of the scientific community about open and collaborative research practices, avoiding redundancies in future scientific efforts and building a solid foundation for an ambitious research agenda.\n\n"}

Much like in the original biological setup, the organizational literature has mostly had simplistic assumptions about agent behavior, embedded in a relatively undefined fitness landscape [10, 73]. However, unlike microbiology, where evolutionary forces are well known [74], defining human search behaviors and assessing the ruggedness of the fitness landscape in this conceptual framework turn out to be elusive.\n### Input: What are the main concerns raised about the theoretical assumptions and empirical grounding of the simulation approach in organizational theory?\n### Response: The main concerns raised about the theoretical assumptions and empirical grounding of the simulation approach in organizational theory are that they are often simplistic and weakly grounded in empirical evidence. The assumptions about agent behavior are often simplistic and embedded in a relatively undefined fitness landscape. Furthermore, defining human search behaviors and assessing the ruggedness of the fitness landscape in this conceptual framework are elusive tasks.\n\n"}

Participant 2 commented: \u201cIt has understood very well the written description I made. It\u2019s a very easy way to get an artistic image, I wouldn\u2019t have done half as good myself.\u201d Additionally, the image generation tool also helped people visualise their ideas, as it forced people to specify details, but also added unspecified elements based on context clues that the participant didn\u2019t specify but appreciated upon seeing it. Overall Visualization Assistance was the secondmost commonly identified code with 10 instances. This finding aligns with previous research on the importance of visualization in design problem-solving [ 6,14] and supports the premise that AI image generation can expand the benefits of visualization in CPS to non-designers.\n### Input: What role does AI-image generation play in enhancing the visualization process in design problem-solving, according to Participant 2's comment and previous research?\n### Response: AI-image generation plays a significant role in enhancing the visualization process in design problem-solving. According to Participant 2's comment, it helps in understanding the written description and creating an artistic image that the participant might not have been able to do themselves. It also helps people visualize their ideas by forcing them to specify details and adding unspecified elements based on context clues. This aligns with previous research that emphasizes the importance of visualization in design problem-solving.

In their 2005 work, Tseitlin et al. [ 27] highlighted that this description does not in- corporate the temporal evolution of the discipline, with ever-growing boundaries where the subject is being explored and rival, inconsistent theories are held. Such a viewpoint considers the historical development of the \ufb01eld to be of great importance [ 31,32]. Historical approaches to the \ufb01eld can be of great value even to modern day researchers, as these alternate viewpoints have proven many times to hold insights which can be useful to both learning [ 33] and to research [ 34] despite being outside the core paradigm. A common example in the context of QST is the Bohr Model, often cited as a historical approach to narrate the early days of quantum mechanics [ 33]. Rather than discarding these approaches, the discipline-culture (DC) framework formulates the discipline as a culture in itself, with its own language and discussions, whereby the alternate accounts \ufb01t into the periphery.\n### Input: What is the significance of historical approaches in the field of Quantum State Tomography (QST) according to the discipline-culture (DC) framework?\n### Response: According to the discipline-culture (DC) framework, historical approaches in the field of Quantum State Tomography (QST) are of great significance. They can provide valuable insights to modern day researchers, even if they are outside the core paradigm. These alternate viewpoints have proven to be useful for both learning and research. An example given is the Bohr Model, which is often used to narrate the early days of quantum mechanics. The DC framework views the discipline as a culture with its own language and discussions, where these alternate accounts fit into the periphery.\n\n"}

Hence, collaborations among academic or non-academic scientists  can be as varies as those between academic and non-academic scientists, highlighting the  importance of context and of individual characteristics.

Yet patients and their caregivers trying to solve their needs and to improve their living conditions hold a tremendous potential as a source of innovation and can enhance the care of others who are similarly affected (Oliveira et al. 2014). Recent initiatives showcase the value of patients as active innovators (i.e., https:\/\/patient-innovation.com). These initiatives provide evidence of how patients can play a leading role in innovating healthcare service delivery. Despite this, patients are not sufficiently seen as co-creators (Elg et al. 2012). Furthermore, when involving patients in co-design, important regulatory, ethical, and social concerns can be raised. Studies should therefore be carefully designed (Heiss & Kokshagina 2021).\n### Input: What potential benefits and challenges are associated with involving patients as co-creators and innovators in healthcare service delivery?\n### Response: The potential benefits of involving patients as co-creators and innovators in healthcare service delivery include the possibility of patients and their caregivers solving their own needs and improving their living conditions. This can enhance the care of others who are similarly affected, and can lead to innovation in healthcare service delivery. However, there are also challenges associated with this approach. Patients are not sufficiently seen as co-creators, and when they are involved in co-design, important regulatory, ethical, and social concerns can be raised. Therefore, studies involving patients as co-creators and innovators need to be carefully designed.\n\n"}

When discussing this relationship, an important underlying assumption became clear: Team members differ in their attitudes toward sharing and collaboration, with junior members favoring openness more strongly than project leaders. Without this assumption, i.e., if all team members agree, open governance may not lead to different decisions than the traditional approach. This led to RQ2 (see Fig. 1): Is the effect of open governance on sharing\/collaboration moderated by the diversity in attitudes towards sharing\/collaboration within the team?   \n### Input: Does the diversity in attitudes towards sharing and collaboration within a research team influence the effectiveness of open governance in promoting sharing and collaboration?\n### Response: The text suggests that this could be the case, leading to the second research question: Is the effect of open governance on sharing\/collaboration moderated by the diversity in attitudes towards sharing\/collaboration within the team?

As established construct validity is by no means a solved problem, convergent validity efforts cannot stand alone. This review therefore highlights the potential of digital games to help build a sufficiently solid methodological foundation of the increasingly complex interactions to foster novel insights into the nature of creativity. To obtain this, various game modes should ideally be aggregated to a comprehensive suite of games exhibiting a diversity of interaction forms and contexts. \n### Input: What potential do digital games have in building a solid methodological foundation for understanding the nature of creativity?\n### Response: The text suggests that digital games have the potential to help build a sufficiently solid methodological foundation for understanding the increasingly complex interactions that foster creativity.

However, predicting individual indicators is not very robust, so we made the pragmatic choice of de\ufb01ning aggregated cognitive abilities measures (Bollen & Bauldry, 2011) while only combining task indicators associated with a cognitive ability in the theory to strengthen its interpretation. The eight accepted models already represent a broad, strong, and rapid testing battery. We exposed these choices to potential discon\ufb01rmation in the current work by examining their agreement across independent estimates; rejecting 3 of 13 while accepting 10. Since the dataset is open, it is also open for potential explorations of alternative choices. We have taken preliminary steps in this direction by pursuing a theory-driven approach, in which we only include the game indicators that are theoretically associated with a speci\ufb01c cognitive ability during the \ufb01tting process. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones presented here but somewhat lower in quantitative effects as expected from a restricted model. Further work in this direction may help the iterative development toward games that are optimally suited for high-quality assessment of each ability.\n### Input: What is the alternative approach to aggregating indicators from multiple tasks as discussed in the paper and why was it not chosen?\n### Response: The alternative approach to aggregating indicators from multiple tasks discussed in the paper is predicting individual task indicators from game data. This approach was not chosen because it is not very robust. Instead, the authors opted for a more pragmatic choice of defining aggregated cognitive abilities measures, combining only task indicators associated with a specific cognitive ability in the theory to strengthen its interpretation.\n\n"}

This led them to conclude that \u201cresearch using only one divergent thinking test will not provide generalizable results\u201d (Runco et al., 2016 , p. 4). If the purpose of an evaluation is to assess general DT or CT, researchers call for multiple domains and tasks to be included (Acar & Runco, 2019 ; Cortes et al., 2019 ; Reiter-Palmon, Forthmann, & Barbot, 2019 ).

For  example, while economics might emphasise the role of incentives in shaping behaviour,  sociology might focus on norms and institutional constraints. In doing so, each discipline  relies on different assumptions about individual agency and social influence. Our frame - work poses questions about the conditions under which one or another perspective has  more explanatory power, as well as how they could be aligned and integrated. Similar  dynamics are at work with the methodological differences between disciplines, whose  effects were observable when we considered the relative proportion and weight of  descriptive studies, correlational quantitative work, field experiments, and other  approaches in informing our framework. We argue that all of these methods have the  potential to drive future research activities, perhaps especially through their integration.  For example, heavily quantitative fields such as economics could benefit from richer  qualitative understanding, while qualitative traditions could be enriched by the larger-  scale insights and opportunities for causal identification that quantitative approaches can  provide. Beyond disciplinary differences as such, involving natural scientists and other  practitioners in the process of conceptualising the framework and writing this article also  brought their unique experiential knowledge into discussions, even as they reported  benefiting from the \u2018outsider\u2019 perspective of social scientists.\n### Input: What are some of the potential benefits of integrating different disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in future research activities, as suggested by the framework in this article?\n### Response: The framework in this article suggests several potential benefits of integrating different disciplinary perspectives and methodologies in future research activities. Firstly, it can help to surface tensions and incongruities between disciplines, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Secondly, it can help to determine under which conditions one perspective has more explanatory power than another. Thirdly, it can help to align and integrate different perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding. Fourthly, it can enrich the research by combining the strengths of different methodologies. For example, quantitative fields could benefit from a richer qualitative understanding, while qualitative traditions could be enriched by the larger-scale insights and opportunities for causal identification that quantitative approaches can provide. Lastly, involving practitioners from different fields can bring unique experiential knowledge into discussions.\n\n"}

Established initiatives toward scalable creativity assessments have relied on well-studied standar - dized tests. Although robust in many ways, most of these tests adopt unnatural and unmotivating  environments for expression of creativity, mainly observe coarse-grained snippets of the creative  process, and rely on subjective, resource-intensive, human-expert evaluations. This article presents  a literature review of game-based creativity assessment and discusses how digital games can  potentially address the limitations of traditional testing. Based on an original sample of 127 papers,  this article contributes an in-depth review of 16 papers on 11 digital creativity assessment games.  Despite the relatively small sample, a wide variety of design decisions are covered. Major findings  and recommendations include identifying (1) a disconnect between the potential of scaling up  assessment of creativity with the use of digital games, and the actual reach achieved in the  examined studies (2) the need for complementary methods such as stealth assessment, algorithmic  support and crowdsourcing when designing creativity assessment games, and (3) a need for  interdisciplinary dialogs to produce, validate and implement creativity assessment games at scale.\n### Input: What are the major findings and recommendations identified in the review of digital creativity assessment games?\n### Response: The major findings and recommendations identified in the review of digital creativity assessment games include: (1) a disconnect between the potential of scaling up assessment of creativity with the use of digital games, and the actual reach achieved in the examined studies, (2) the need for complementary methods such as stealth assessment, algorithmic support and crowdsourcing when designing creativity assessment games, and (3) a need for interdisciplinary dialogs to produce, validate and implement creativity assessment games at scale.\n\n"}

For instance,  groups\u2019 principal investigators (PI) generally take a lead role in driving collaborations  with industry, requiring them to be \u2018jacks of all trades\u2019. In taking on the roles of project  manager, negotiator, and resource acquirer, as well as that of researcher, PIs develop a set  of competences and experiences that allow them to function as boundary spanners  between academia and industry (Boehm and Hogan 2014 ). Yet they are also called  upon to care for the careers and well-being of the graduate students and postdocs within  their groups, even to the point of refusing discourses of responsible research and  innovation in favour of a more localised sense of responsibility (Davies and Horst  2015 ).\n### Input: What roles do principal investigators (PI) play within a research group and how does this influence their ability to function as boundary spanners between academia and industry?\n### Response: Principal investigators (PI) within a research group play multiple roles. They act as project managers, negotiators, and resource acquirers, as well as researchers. These roles require them to develop a set of competences and experiences that allow them to function as boundary spanners between academia and industry. They are responsible for driving collaborations with industry, which requires them to be versatile and adaptable. Additionally, PIs are also responsible for the careers and well-being of the graduate students and postdocs within their groups. This may involve prioritizing a more localized sense of responsibility over broader discourses of responsible research and innovation. These various roles and responsibilities enable PIs to bridge the gap between academia and industry.\n\n"}

Individuals, the teams or groups they compose, and their performance are highly influenced by the attitudes and behaviours of their peers, as well as by prevailing local norms. These effects may also influence how individual actors perceive and engage with OIS. For example, when deciding to collaborate with industry or engage in patenting activities, academic scientists tend to mimic the behaviour of departmental colleagues at a similar stage in their careers (Moog et al. 2015 ; Tartari, Perkmann, and Salter 2014 ) and the prevailing department culture instead of taking their lead from university patenting policies (Bercovitz and Feldman 2008 ; Kenney and Goe 2004 ). While the presence of role models can positively affect academic scientists\u2019 propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities (Huyghe and Knockaert 2015 ), such effects nevertheless remain variable, in part because individual scientists vary in the degree to which they are influenced by their peers. For example, early-career researchers are more influenced by the collaboration behaviour of peers in their immediate social environment (Tartari, Perkmann, and Salter 2014 ). Likewise, the industry involvement of younger scientists has been shown to increase with the industry orientation of local peers (Aschhoff and Grimpe 2014 ). However, this relationship may not hold for all forms of OIS.\n### Input: How does the behavior and attitudes of peers and local norms influence the engagement of individual actors with Open Innovation Systems (OIS)?\n### Response: The behavior and attitudes of peers and local norms can significantly influence the engagement of individual actors with Open Innovation Systems (OIS).

However, we show that the commonly used measure for how rugged a landscape is does not capture how social science landscapes might be ordered by a hierarchy [21] or how neutrality influences ruggedness [18]. Second, we provide a novel (to the social science literature) type of visualization that maps how different search strategies actually \u201cgenerate\u201d different landscapes, rather than merely constituting search in an a priori given space. The conceptualization of the fitness landscape is thus not independent of assumptions about search behavior. This interdependence was not an issue in the original NK model, since it assumed a particular search strategy of genes engaging in local-search with occasional random jumps [6]. Yet, if one changes the parameters of search behavior, the assessment of the difficulty of a fitness landscape should be able to take the impact of changing parameters into account.\n### Input: How does changing the parameters of search behavior impact the assessment of the difficulty of a fitness landscape in social science studies?\n### Response: The text suggests that changing the parameters of search behavior can impact the assessment of the difficulty of a fitness landscape in social science studies by altering the perceived complexity or ruggedness of the landscape. This is because the conceptualization of the fitness landscape is not independent of assumptions about search behavior. Therefore, if the parameters of search behavior are changed, the assessment of the landscape's difficulty should be able to account for these changes.\n\n"}

The setting for this study is a research project aimed at co-creating an approach to building child-centered support systems around children of parents with mental illness. One of the main challenges in this study is that developing such support systems requires not only fundamental changes to the healthcare system, and thus the involvement of experts and professional users, but that it also requires meaningful involvement of vulnerable or disadvantaged participants (parents with mental illness and their children who are at high risk of developing mental illness). For the project to succeed, these vulnerable participants must be encouraged to participate in the study and supported if they are to contribute effectively to the aims of the project. They must do so in collaboration with experts and professional users and thus in a context of substantial power differentials, which may negatively impact their collaborative and open participation.\n### Input: How can vulnerable participants, such as parents with mental illness and their children, be effectively and meaningfully involved in a research project aimed at co-creating child-centered support systems, considering the power differentials with experts and professional users?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific strategies or methods for effectively and meaningfully involving vulnerable participants, such as parents with mental illness and their children, in a research project aimed at co-creating child-centered support systems, considering the power differentials with experts and professional users.\n\n"}

Creative processes are explored extensively in the burgeoning field of creativity support tools and co-creative systems [ 13,23,25, 30]. These fields are faced with a fundamental trade-off between imposed constraints, granularity of the problem representation, and user control [ 8,18]: On one hand, low degrees of automated support leave the user in more control, but typically at the expense of requiring extensive training or labor in performing fine-grained operations during the creation of creative products. On the other hand, high levels of automated support may enable rapid production of creative products, but the loss of detailed user control leaves unclear the relevance and level of human creativity in the process. In this paper, we present a new co-creative system, crea.blender and use it to investigate if a ML-based image generation game can provide appropriate, coarse-grained support to allow for playful and scalable assessment of human creativity. \n### Input: Can a ML-based image generation game, such as crea.blender, provide appropriate, coarse-grained support to allow for playful and scalable assessment of human creativity?\n### Response: The text suggests that the authors believe a ML-based image generation game like crea.blender could potentially provide appropriate, coarse-grained support for a playful and scalable assessment of human creativity. However, it does not definitively confirm this as it seems to be the subject of their investigation.\n\n"}

The research approach was either empirical, when data collection was involved, or theoretical, when there was no data involved. In total, there were 13 empirical, and 3 theoretical papers. Among the empirical studies, it was possible to distinguish between usability studies (participant\u2019s user behavior and interaction with the tool was observed; Rafner et al., 2020), experimental (creativity was studied under two or more experimental conditions; Ali et al., 2019; Noy et al., 2012; Voiskounsky et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2016), correlational (investigated which variables have a natural relationship with creativity; Gal et al., 2017; Rozenkrantz et al., 2017; Voiskounsky et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2016), and validation (tested for correlation with preexisting, standard measures; Chuang et al., 2015; Hart et al., 2017; Howell & Veale, 2010; Krebs et al., 2020; Rozenkrantz et al., 2017; Shute & Rahimi, 2021) studies (some belonging to multiple categories).

The games were developed and tested in a blended-learning environment, in which the games were deployed in a classroom with a teacher and instructors at hand to help and guide the sessions. The aim was to develop the games such that they required no previous knowledge about differentiation, but it could also be used to refresh students\u2019 differentiation knowledge at later stages of their education. Previous studies (Bj\u00e6lde et al., 2014; Adams et al., 2008) have  showed that it is often the lower tier of students, who learn the most from games. However, it remains an open question whether these results are just a case of diminishing returns (the more you know the less there is to learn), or if gamified teaching appeals to a different segment of students than traditional lectures. Thus, the stude nts are divided into lower, middle, or upper tiers of students based on overall performance in DiffG ame and their learning gains are compared.\n### Input: What is the primary aim of the DiffGame and how does it cater to different tiers of students in terms of their understanding of differentiation?\n### Response: The primary aim of DiffGame is to introduce the basic principles of differentiation to high-school students through game-like elements. The game is designed in such a way that it requires no previous knowledge about differentiation, making it accessible to beginners. However, it can also be used to refresh the differentiation knowledge of students at later stages of their education. The game caters to different tiers of students by dividing them into lower, middle, or upper tiers based on their overall performance in DiffGame. Their learning gains are then compared, allowing for an assessment of how the game benefits students of varying levels of understanding and knowledge.\n\n"}

Moreover, internal policies and protocols can also be seen as organisational infra - structures intended to foster industry collaboration. For example, university-level patent regulations can signal organisational commitment to patenting activities (Baldini, Grimaldi, and Sobrero 2007 ). But official policies may also lead to symbolic rather than actual changes to behaviour: researchers may engage in superficial compliance with local policies regarding entrepreneurial behaviour, pretending to live up to expectations without actually reorienting their research (Bercovitz and Feldman 2008 ). Similarly, mechanisms to support spinout formation do not necessarily strengthen researchers\u2019 incentives to start a company (Fini, Grimaldi, and Sobrero 2009 ). More successful endeavours centre trust, communication, and the role of intermediaries to facilitate knowledge transfer and resolve barriers such as ambiguity and difficulties with knowledge absorption and application (de Wit-de Vries et al. 2019 ). One intriguing model initiated by CERN involved setting up business incubation centres in its sponsoring states to support entrepreneurs in taking CERN technologies and know-how to market.\n### Input: What role do trust, communication, and intermediaries play in facilitating knowledge transfer and resolving barriers in the implementation of a Technology Transfer Office (TTO)?\n### Response: The text suggests that trust, communication, and intermediaries play a crucial role in facilitating knowledge transfer and resolving barriers in the implementation of a Technology Transfer Office (TTO). They help to overcome challenges such as ambiguity and difficulties with knowledge absorption and application. These elements are seen as more successful endeavours in the implementation of a TTO, compared to official policies and mechanisms that may lead to superficial compliance or do not necessarily strengthen researchers' incentives.\n\n"}

The application of OIS practices may further exacerbate these challenges. For example, when reviewing research proposals in terms of societal impact, it is difficult to find reviewers with the capacity to evaluate at different stages and from different perspectives (Holbrook 2005). More generally, the (scientific) outputs of an expanded set of stakeholders can have a multitude of effects that can scarcely be captured by a single assessment mechanism (Molas-Gallart and Tang 2011).\n### Input: What challenges might be faced when assessing the societal impact of research and innovation, and how might the application of OIS practices exacerbate these challenges?\n### Response: Assessing the societal impact of research and innovation can be challenging due to issues such as establishing causality, attribution, national borders, and time delays.

Furthermore, digitized tests  are not necessarily more meaningful to the participants  than the pen- and paper-based versions. Product-oriented assessment In contrast to process-oriented assessments, among  others, Baer and Kaufman (Baer, Kaufman, & Gentile,  2004 ) argue that product-based assessments (e.g., poetry,  collage, music) are probably \u201cthe most appropriate  assessments of creativity\u201d as they \u201cindicate ability to  produce creative products past or present\u201d (Kaufman  & Sternberg, 2019 , p. 54). The evaluation of such tasks  was operationalized by Amabile in a method known as  the Consensual Assessment Technique (Amabile, 1982 ).  This method involves a group of expert raters (i.e.,  appropriate observers familiar with the domain of the  creative product) individually and independently scor- ing a set of products. The Consensual Assessment  Technique has been espoused as a, if not the gold stan- dard (Baer et al., 2004 ) in creativity assessment and  considered a versatile, reliable measure of creativity  negating the need for explicit definitions (Cseh &  Jeffries, 2019 ). This technique relies completely on  resource-intensive human rating, especially as expert  raters are sometimes hard to find. However, the require - ments for one to be an expert, and information on  training or guidance of judges is not well defined (Cseh  & Jeffries, 2019 ). This uncertainty, coupled with rapid  technological developments, has led to initial studies of  crowdsourced consensual assessment, however the  results have been mixed (see McKenna, Arnone, Kaarst-  Brown, McKnight, & Chauncey, 2013 ).\n### Input: What is the Consensual Assessment Technique in creativity assessment and what are some of its potential limitations?\n### Response: The Consensual Assessment Technique in creativity assessment is a method that involves a group of expert raters, who are familiar with the domain of the creative product, individually and independently scoring a set of products.

However, these practices are each grounded in particular networks of stakeholders, institutional logics, and conventional domains of application. Drawing connections between them as instances of purposively managed knowledge flows across boundaries both challenges prior assumptions and carries new potential. Future research must therefore begin to uncover synergies and complementarities between these practices as they function within the scientific environment. For example, the use of crowdsourcing could take on a new civic aspect if used to identify new research problems in conjunction with the practice of priority setting for mission-driven research (for an early experiment in this, see Beck et al. 2020 ).\n### Input: What potential synergies and complementarities could be uncovered between OIS practices within the scientific environment, such as the use of crowdsourcing and priority setting for mission-driven research?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific examples of potential synergies and complementarities that could be uncovered between OIS practices within the scientific environment, such as the use of crowdsourcing and priority setting for mission-driven research.\n\n"}

None of the groups involved in the experiment failed to produce a research proposal, and all participants followed through on their commitment to openly share the experiment\u2019s outcome as a publication. Hence, with remedies at hand such as skilled facilitators, a concise and engaging process, and a committed team, co-development can lay the groundwork for setting research agendas that trigger use-inspired research projects that both address relevant questions and advance theory. By sharing the purpose, process, outcome, and reflections on this experimental approach to co-developing scientific research proposals, we hope to encourage future co-development endeavours for the sake of producing more novel and impactful research across different scientific disciplines. Likewise, we hope to encourage future researchers interested in the co-production of scientific knowledge to address the limitations of our experiment, for example by empirically assessing and comparing the quality of the resulting proposals with others developed through a conventional process. Last but not least, we hope to encourage scientists who did not take part in this experiment but are interested in the problems outlined in the proposals (see Appendix B) to reach out to the co-authors, get involved in a project, and thereby contribute to the co-production of scientific knowledge about open and collaborative research.\n### Input: What are some potential ways future researchers could address the limitations of the experiment in co-developing scientific research proposals, as mentioned in the text?\n### Response: The text suggests that future researchers could address the limitations of the experiment in co-developing scientific research proposals by empirically assessing and comparing the quality of the resulting proposals with others developed through a conventional process.\n\n"}

Looking only at those players who chose the correct set of source images, we see how they consistently get closer to the target. Reading Figure 4 from left to right shows player progression towards the target. If a player reaches 0 on the y-axis, they have perfectly re-created the target. The orange line (Player 2) shows near-monotonic convergence towards the target-image while the blue line (Player 1) shows more explorative progression. For all players, we see at most two \u2018worsenings\u2019 away from the target image before the player corrects their action and moves closer to the target image. This suggests that players recognize when they have gone off track and immediately know how to correct it, and thus are indeed in some sense in control during the Challenge mode.\n### Input: What does the player's progression towards the target in Figure 4 suggest about their control during the Challenge mode?\n### Response: The player's progression towards the target in Figure 4 suggests that they are in control during the Challenge mode. This is indicated by their ability to recognize when they have deviated from the target image and immediately correct their action to move closer to the target.\n\n"}

However, there is a growing recognition that autonomous deep learning-based approaches often are not robust enough to solve real-world problems in noisy, unpredictable and dynamically varying environments including serious failures in visual recognition, chatbot training, and self-driving cars (Heaven, 2019; Marcus, 2018). Many tasks can therefore still only achieve the required quality and reliability with some form of human-in-the-loop input for training, execution or verification (Benedikt et al., 2020; Zanzotto, 2019). Even highly publicized research on self-learning AI in games such as AlphaZero has either required manual adaptation (Silver et al., 2018) or extensive learning from human data (Vinyals et al., 2019) and has been exceedingly difficult to generalize beyond its field (Dalgaard et al., 2020; Toma\u0161ev et al., 2020). \n### Input: What are some of the limitations and failures of autonomous deep learning-based approaches in real-world applications, and how does this make a case for Hybrid Intelligence in Citizen Science?\n### Response: The limitations and failures of autonomous deep learning-based approaches in real-world applications include a lack of robustness to solve problems in noisy, unpredictable, and dynamically varying environments. There have been serious failures in visual recognition, chatbot training, and self-driving cars. Many tasks can only achieve the required quality and reliability with some form of human-in-the-loop input for training, execution, or verification. Even research on self-learning AI in games has required manual adaptation or extensive learning from human data and has been difficult to generalize beyond its field. These limitations and failures make a case for Hybrid Intelligence in Citizen Science, as it suggests that human input and intervention are still necessary to ensure the quality, reliability, and generalizability of AI solutions.\n\n"}

As discussed in the introduction, this bias  toward DT assessment is common in current creativ - ity research. Crea.blender (Rafner et al., 2020 )  describes a visual CT mode, in which players are pre- sented with a target image and three sets of starting  images. The players must choose which set produced  the target image, and then recreate it. In contrast to  BuzzWords (Howell & Veale, 2009 ; 2010 ; Howell &  Veale, 2009 ), this task does not rely on the player\u2019s  verbal skills for finding the right solution. However, it  relies heavily on the player\u2019s ability to understand and  work with the mechanisms of the image-generating  algorithm, otherwise the player could not make  a correct prediction. The authors addressed this  exact issue in a small pilot study, and the results  suggest that participants are able to understand and  control the mechanics successfully (Rafner et al.,  2020 ), based on which, this could be a promising  approach for non-verbal CT assessment.\n### Input: What is the difference between the Crea.blender task and the BuzzWords task in terms of the skills they rely on, according to the text?\n### Response: The Crea.blender task relies on the player's ability to understand and work with the mechanisms of the image-generating algorithm, while the BuzzWords task relies on the player's verbal skills to find the right solution.\n\n"}

While citizen science holds promise for human-machine inte- gration, we are just beginning to understand, for example, difficulties arising from  designing human-machine systems for serendipitous discovery (Trouille, Lintott, and  Fortson 2019 ).\n### Input: What are some of the benefits and challenges of integrating human-machine systems in citizen science projects?\n### Response: The benefits of integrating human-machine systems in citizen science projects include the generation of new domain-specific knowledge and innovations, critical insight into how humans solve problems individually and collectively compared to machines, and unique learning opportunities for citizens. However, challenges may arise from designing these systems for serendipitous discovery.\n\n"}

One domain in which these issues are being worked out by researchers and practitioners alike is that of Open Science (OS). OS can be understood as an umbrella term encompassing a variety of assumptions about knowledge production and dissemination (Fecher et al. 2017). The three pillars of OS are accessibility (e.g. open access to publications and research data), transparency (e.g. reproducibility of results, open peer review), and inclusivity (e.g. citizen science) (Vicente-S\u00e1ez and Mart\u00ednez-Fuentes 2018). While the first and most broadly accepted two focus on access to existing scientific outputs and processes, only the third envisions opening up the knowledge production process itself.\n### Input: What are the three pillars of Open Science and how do they contribute to the knowledge production and dissemination process?\n### Response: The three pillars of Open Science (OS) are accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity. Accessibility refers to open access to publications and research data, which allows for the wider dissemination of scientific outputs. Transparency, which includes reproducibility of results and open peer review, ensures that the scientific process is open and accountable, contributing to the credibility and reliability of the knowledge produced. Inclusivity, such as citizen science, opens up the knowledge production process itself, allowing for a broader range of contributors and perspectives in the scientific process. This not only democratizes science, but also potentially enriches the knowledge produced.\n\n"}

In principle, the digital nature of tasks in digital tests allows for a more fine-grained data analysis, in which not only the final product, but also the process (e.g., time-ordering of inputs) is taken into account for the evaluation (Evans, Holmes, & Trueblood, 2019 ). However, this potential is far from being fully exploited in creativity assessment.\n### Input: What are the potential benefits of using digital, standardized creativity assessments and how can the digital nature of these tests contribute to a more detailed data analysis?\n### Response: The potential benefits of using digital, standardized creativity assessments include reducing human subjectivity in scoring responses, making testing more accessible to administer, and allowing for a more fine-grained data analysis.

Research designs that cross levels of analysis in this way promise a deeper understanding of OIS and stand to have important implications for the spheres of practice and policy. The OIS Research Framework also points to potential tensions and conflicts that may arise in pursuit of purposefully opening the scientific research process. For example, greater openness with respect to research data and other outputs may undermine efforts at technology commercialisation, which typically requires appropriation. Likewise, when designing the implementation of certain practices, attention will need to be paid to the multiple functions that these practices might have and the potential existence of trade-offs between them (e.g. citizen science can result in both scientific and broader societal impacts). These essential tensions (Hackett 2005 ) and interdependencies are, in our view, at the heart of research on openness and collaboration in science.\n### Input: What potential conflicts and tensions may arise in the pursuit of purposefully opening the scientific research process according to the OIS Research Framework?\n### Response: According to the OIS Research Framework, potential conflicts and tensions may arise from greater openness with respect to research data and other outputs, which may undermine efforts at technology commercialisation, typically requiring appropriation.

In contrast to modular simulations, Composer uses a \ufb02exi- ble, drag-and-drop interface allowing students and instruc- tors to build or modify simulations (called \ufb02owscenes ) from the ground-up without any prior programming knowledge. With Composer, a variety of one-dimensional quantum sce- narios can be simulated, and the statics and dynamics of prob- lems can be explored through a large range of visualization tools [27]. As this is a new and unstudied tool, we aim to \ufb01rst explore broadly how students use it to reason about canonical quantum mechanical systems. To accomplish this goal, we use think-aloud interviews of students working through an exercise using Quantum Composer. We \ufb01nd that when stu- dents are presented with a pre-made simulation in Composer and surrounding exercise materials, they are able to use the visualization tools contained in the simulation to help build and reinforce their understanding of a problem. \n### Input: What are the benefits of using Quantum Composer for students learning about quantum mechanical systems and how does it enhance their understanding of the subject?\n### Response: Quantum Composer offers several benefits for students learning about quantum mechanical systems. It uses a flexible, drag-and-drop interface that allows students and instructors to build or modify simulations from the ground-up without any prior programming knowledge. This makes it accessible to a wide range of students. It can simulate a variety of one-dimensional quantum scenarios, and the statics and dynamics of problems can be explored through a large range of visualization tools. This allows students to interact with and visualize complex quantum concepts in a more tangible way. When students are presented with a pre-made simulation in Composer and surrounding exercise materials, they are able to use the visualization tools contained in the simulation to help build and reinforce their understanding of a problem. This hands-on, visual approach can enhance their understanding of the subject by making abstract concepts more concrete and understandable.\n\n"}

It is relevant to understand the total number of distinct images that could be produced in principle by the full input space of the GAN. Images were produced by blending up to 4 images chosen from a pool of 102 source images, which gives about 4*106different starting sets of source images. The sliders were quasi-continuous, but if we conservatively assume that only 10 different values for each slider give reasonably distinguishable changes in the resulting image, the lower bound is about 108unique slider settings per image set and 4*1014possible output images. To quantify the extent to which people actually explored this space, we look at both the diversity of the 4 source images chosen, and the range of slider values used for them. Frequency of selecting a source image was over-dispersed by factor of two relative to the binomial distribution expected under chance, indicating that some source images were more popular than others. However, each source image was used in at least 23 generated images and no source image was used in more than 99. Style and content slider values were correlated at r =.49 (i.e. somewhat reducing the effective size of the space explored), but there was no association between source image and slider value. Although these results suggest saved images came from diverse regions of the space, it is important to check for the appearance of possible clusters of similar images as people might have been attracted to particular images. To test this, we clustered the images using the k-means algorithm with 100 clusters (30 repetitions) in the 2*102 dimensional space corresponding to the two slider values for each possible source image (see Fig. 2). There is one large cluster with about 195 images, and the remaining clusters have a mean image count of 13 \u00b18. There are about 24 clusters generated by\n### Input: What does the analysis reveal about the flexibility of crea.blender SDG in producing both utopian and dystopian images?\n### Response: The analysis reveals that crea.blender SDG offers significant flexibility in producing both utopian and dystopian images. The total number of distinct images that could be produced by the full input space of the GAN is about 4*1014, indicating a vast range of possible output images. The diversity of the source images chosen and the range of slider values used also suggest that saved images came from diverse regions of the space. However, there was a tendency for some source images to be more popular than others, and there was a correlation between style and content slider values. Despite this, no specific association was found between source image and slider value. The presence of clusters of similar images was also noted, suggesting that users might have been attracted to particular images.\n\n"}

These include the design of specific incentives for ensuring the reproducibility of results, which could benefit faster dissemination and iteration of scientific findings (Nielsen 2011 ; Nosek et al. 2015 ). Incentives for open and collaborative behaviour can take a range of forms. For example, some publications have found that researchers are more likely to share their research data when a badge indicating whether results have been reproduced or replicated is published along with their article (Kidwell et al. 2016 ), although the evidence here is mixed (Rowhani-Farid, Aldcroft, and Barnett INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION  153).\n### Input: What types of incentives may be required to motivate the implementation of open and collaborative approaches in research, and how might these incentives promote the reproducibility of results and faster dissemination of scientific findings?\n### Response: The text suggests that collectively oriented incentives may be required to motivate the implementation of open and collaborative approaches in research. These incentives could include the design of specific rewards for ensuring the reproducibility of results. Such incentives could promote the reproducibility of results and faster dissemination of scientific findings by encouraging researchers to share their data and findings more openly. For instance, some studies have found that researchers are more likely to share their research data when a badge indicating whether results have been reproduced or replicated is published along with their article. This could potentially lead to faster dissemination and iteration of scientific findings. However, the evidence on the effectiveness of such incentives is mixed.\n\n"}

Multimodality plays a significant role in enabling the exchange of thoughts, beliefs, and emotions, and can be particularly important in contexts where linguistic communication is difficult or impossible (e.g., Pierce et al. 2019). Some researchers have explored prospects for participatory research using arts-based methodologies, arguing for the integration of practices like photography, dance, and filmmaking into research processes as a way to understand lived experiences that might otherwise be inaccessible (e.g., Lenette 2019).\n### Input: What are some examples of multimodal research methods and how do they contribute to the understanding of lived experiences in contexts where linguistic communication is difficult or impossible?\n### Response: The text mentions that multimodal research methods can include the use of different and often overlapping modalities of communication such as textual, auditory, linguistic, spatial, and visual. Some researchers have explored the use of arts-based methodologies in participatory research. These can include practices like photography, dance, and filmmaking. These methods contribute to the understanding of lived experiences in contexts where linguistic communication is difficult or impossible by providing alternative ways to express and communicate thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. For instance, a person might use dance to express emotions that they find difficult to put into words, or use photography to capture aspects of their lived experience that might be hard to describe verbally.\n\n"}

Anticipated in early work by critics demanding a more \u2018social  orientation of science\u2019 (Schroyer 1984 , 715), new context-driven modes of knowledge  production have developed that are centrally concerned with solving societal problems  and are therefore more likely to transgress traditional disciplinary boundaries or distinc - tions between academic and applied research (Gibbons et al. 1994 ). Taking stock of these  shifts, Dasgupta and David (1994 ) formulated a \u2018new economics of science\u2019, today one of  the cornerstones of our understanding of the mechanisms of scientific openness and  collaboration. However, changing conditions both within science (e.g. increased compe - tition for permanent positions, increased specialisation, the globalisation of the scientific  workforce) and outside of it (e.g. professionalisation of non-scientific actors, calls for  public engagement and the democratisation of science, policy-driven agenda setting,  global crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak) require a novel approach to thinking about INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION  137\n### Input: What are some of the changing conditions within and outside of science that require a novel approach to fostering openness and collaboration in the field?\n### Response: Within science, some of the changing conditions include increased competition for permanent positions, increased specialisation, and the globalisation of the scientific workforce.

Healthcare is unique in that it is mostly a \u201cneed\u201d rather than a \u201cwant\u201d service (Berry 2019). A variety of different stakeholders, such as political leaders, staff, taxpayers, regulatory bodies, and suppliers, often have conflicting goals and requirements (Moorhead et al. 2013). With the overall goal of a healthcare system being to deliver quality health-care outcomes to patients, individual stakeholders are motivated by their own goals and business logics (Guercini et al. 2020, Kokshagina & Ker\u00e4nen 2021, Schiavone & Simoni 2019). Co-creation can be an efficient way to integrate various stakeholders when developing innovative products and services. But how can these stakeholders be leveraged and integrated in a meaningful way? This research project explores how (former) prostate cancer patients, their caregivers, and their relatives can work together to facilitate improvements to the lives of patients with prostate cancer. By integrating various OIS approaches, this research explores methods for efficiently co-designing with patients.\n### Input: How can various stakeholders in the healthcare system be effectively integrated and leveraged for the co-creation of innovative products and services, specifically in the context of improving the lives of prostate cancer patients?\n### Response: The proposal suggests that various stakeholders in the healthcare system can be effectively integrated and leveraged for the co-creation of innovative products and services through the use of Open Innovation Systems (OIS) approaches. This involves working together with (former) prostate cancer patients, their caregivers, and their relatives to facilitate improvements. The research aims to explore methods for efficiently co-designing with patients, implying a collaborative and participatory approach to innovation where the experiences, needs, and insights of patients and their support network are central to the process.\n\n"}

We collected preliminary data about the features raters attended to with the three-option \u2019reason\u2019 question following each image classification. The proportions of each reason given for the ratingswere broadly similar across utopia and dystopia decisions: overall ratings, 50% were reported as motivated by color, 29% by motif, and 21% by style. Agreement on reason decisions gave a Fleiss kappa 0.12 (z =11, p<.001). The categorization of utopias and dystopias cuts across the phys- ical features of the landscapes as shown by the high variation in the selection of source images and their blend proportions. Despite the apparent lack of a set of necessary and sufficient criteria for making these categorization decisions, we found that blind ratings of category membership agreed with each other and with creator intention at levels above chance. It is not clear what features cre- ators are attending to when deciding which images are distinctively utopian or dystopian. Our results suggest that color might be par- ticularly salient, but also that rater agreement on the reasons for a particular classification is low. The fact that raters were more motivated by color (50%) than by motif (29%) could be caused by the fact that all source images were selected from enquiry into \u2018landscape\u2019 on Artbreeder, which may have led to a reduced spread in perceived motifs. Alternatively, no participants had training in image analysis, and color may simply be more salient to the novice eye than other features.\n### Input: What components of the images were most recognizable as utopian and dystopian according to the preliminary data collected?\n### Response: According to the preliminary data collected, the components of the images most recognizable as utopian and dystopian were color (50%), motif (29%), and style (21%).\n\n"}

Thus, one cannot score the participants\u2019 input objectively. Instead, the annotation is consensus-based (absence of a ground truth). The elements to be annotated are often images or audio recordings or transcriptions (Causer and Terras, 2014; Lintott et al., 2008; Nugent, 2019; Tinati et al., 2017). The annotated data can be used to train ML classification models which fall into the paradigm of supervised learning (SL). Franzen et al. (2021) refers to a subset of these types of tasks as \u2018classification,\u2019 however this term is not broad enough to encompass transcription analysis which is analyzed using the same ML paradigm and thus fits under the umbrella category, annotation tasks.\n### Input: What is the role of annotated data in the training of Machine Learning classification models?\n### Response: The role of annotated data in the training of Machine Learning classification models is to provide a basis for supervised learning. The models learn from this annotated data to make future predictions or classifications.\n\n"}

INTRODUCTION There have been several studies identifying challenges students have with building a conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics at both the undergraduate and graduate level [1\u201311]. For example, it has been shown that students face dif\ufb01culties in sketching the shape of a wavefunction even if they know the correct mathematical form [2]. Students also struggle with correctly describing the time evolution of a non- stationary state [2, 3, 12] and the real and imaginary parts of a stationary state [13]. Thus, tools that allow students to visualize and simulate quantum phenomena may foster bet- ter student understanding of challenging concepts in quantum mechanics. \n### Input: What tools could potentially help students better understand challenging concepts in quantum mechanics, such as the shape of a wavefunction or the time evolution of a non-stationary state?\n### Response: The text suggests that tools which allow students to visualize and simulate quantum phenomena could potentially help them better understand challenging concepts in quantum mechanics.\n\n"}

First, employing an open and  collaborative approach allowed us to bridge disciplinary differences in terms of under - lying norms, theories, assumptions, methods, and languages. This interdisciplinary  approach made it possible to synthesise what dispersed fields within the scientific  community already know about open and collaborative research practices. Second,  integrating different perspectives provided a more comprehensive picture that identifies  robust results but also contradictions, tensions, and inconsistencies across scientific  fields. These highlight the need for methodologically diverse inquiry to better understand  the antecedents, boundary conditions, and consequences of open and collaborative  research. Third, structuring the knowledge about open and collaborative research  1While various definitions of inter- and transdisciplinary research refer to different constitutive elements (e.g. on the level  of knowledge integration, see Piaget 1972 ), we refer to interdisciplinary research in terms of crossing boundaries of  existing scientific disciplines and transdisciplinary research in terms of crossing the boundaries of the science system to  involve actors other than academic scientists such as citizens, companies, and policymakers.\n### Input: What are the three ways in which the article contributes to science, policy-making, practice, and society through its focus on open and collaborative research practices?\n### Response: The article contributes in three ways. Firstly, it uses an open and collaborative approach to bridge disciplinary differences, synthesising knowledge from various scientific fields about open and collaborative research practices. Secondly, it integrates different perspectives to provide a comprehensive picture that identifies robust results as well as contradictions, tensions, and inconsistencies across scientific fields, highlighting the need for diverse inquiry.

Sev- eral of the problems required students to use programming tools like MATLAB. Three times throughout the course, the students were given additional exercises built around Com- poser \ufb02owscenes (see Fig.1). None of the exercises were graded. Students were provided with relevant \ufb02owscenes, and the exercises were designed so that students did not have to build anything from scratch (although they were shown how this could be done). The \ufb01rst set of exercises explored the in- \ufb01nite and \ufb01nite square well, the second set investigated super- position and expectation values, and the third discussed time- independent perturbation theory. None of the Composer ex- ercises explored time dependence, but time-dependence was explored in the course. Before the \ufb01rst exercise, students were given a 15-minute presentation on how to use Composer. \n### Input: What were the three topics explored in the set of exercises built around Composer flowscenes in the quantum course?\n### Response: The three topics explored in the set of exercises built around Composer flowscenes in the quantum course were the infinite and finite square well, superposition and expectation values, and time-independent perturbation theory.\n\n"}

A conceptual mapping of terms is necessary to effectively exploit the extensive insights from each research tradition in the interdisciplinary endeavor towards optimal human-machine problem-solving. Then, we examine several projects and their potential for AI-enhancement through two key dimensions: the degree of digitization and the accessibility to make a scientific contribution. We do this to concretely illustrate which types of CS tasks are ideally suited for which types of machine support.\n### Input: What are the two key dimensions examined to determine the potential for AI-enhancement in CS projects?\n### Response: The two key dimensions examined to determine the potential for AI-enhancement in CS projects are the degree of digitization and the accessibility to make a scientific contribution.\n\n"}

This journey begins with an introduction to knowledge in the periphery, which is later formalised into core principles in the nucleus. Working applications are then discussed and understood in the body, before returning to the periphery to emphasize the evolving, incomplete nature of the discipline-culture. This approach supports the understanding of a discipline's culture and scientific thinking by addressing each topic with scientific thinking and allowing participants to face the evolving nature of their field. This process supports epistemological advancement, which is the understanding and knowledge of how we know what we know.\n\n"}

This article makes two main contributions. First, we share insights into a novel approach to integrating relevant problem knowledge gained from the users of scientific research into the process of developing research proposals. This approach goes beyond efforts to include token contributory efforts from different stakeholders when setting research agendas and suggests that collaboratively developing research proposals has significant potential to produce problem-inspired contributions to advancing the knowledge frontiers across different scientific disciplines. Co-developing research proposals does not only involve the identification of particular problems, but also includes collaborative learning as participants spot relevant gaps in existing knowledge, define related research questions or hypotheses, and develop an appropriate research design. Second, we share the results of this process (i.e., six concrete research proposals) in an open access publication in order to invite scholars interested in studying the role.\n### Input: What are the two main contributions of the article regarding the integration of problem knowledge into the development of research proposals and the results of this process?\n### Response: The two main contributions of the article are: firstly, it provides insights into a novel approach to integrating problem knowledge from the users of scientific research into the process of developing research proposals.

Organisational-level antecedents and boundary conditions Individual scientists and research teams or groups are usually embedded in larger research organisations, from universities and their subunits (i.e. departments) to more experimental multidisciplinary institutes (Mosey, Wright, and Clarysse 2012 ). Antecedents and boundary conditions at the organisational level can influence the (successful) application of OIS practices. Hence, there are organisational capabilities that influence the ability to adopt open and collaborative practices, such as absorptive capacity (Piezunka and Dahlander 2015 ), epistemic stance about the innovation process (Fayard, Gkeredakis, and Levina 2016 ), and frame flexibility (Raffaelli, Glynn, and Tushman 2019 ).

BY ROSALIA BITTERL, AMELIE DORN, RIOLD FURTUNA, MELINDA GOODYEAR, BARBARA HEINISCH, AND MARIA-THERESA NORN OIS challenge: The challenge presented to the conference audience concerned the codesign process previously undertaken in the Austrian Village Project (Christiansen et al. 2019). The Village Project is funded as an Open Innovation in Science research project to codesign, implement and test new practice approaches to help address the needs of children of parents with a mental illness (Goodyear et al. 2019). Using OIS principles, the project undertook a significant process of codesign with stakeholders representing funders, service leads, managers, services users, a range of professionals across the psychiatric disciplines, social services, and education. This Village Project is coordinated by an interdisciplinary group of researchers with the support of a competence group consisting of young people with their own lived experience of growing up with a parent with a mental illness. A core dilemma throughout this process of codesign and the implementation of open innovation methods was in managing and creating the conditions for meaningful participation of all engaged stakeholders. Meaningful participation was important to ensure the codesign process was open and not driven by those more likely to hold the \u2018power\u2019 in this process, while also achieving a design outcome within the time limited project. The challenge is to achieve an open process alongside the \u2018power differentials\u2019 that arise when working with people with lived experience who might experience disadvantage, or the hierarchical differences that emerge across professions, sectors, and levels of seniority.\n### Input: What strategies can be implemented to manage power differentials and ensure meaningful participation of all stakeholders in the codesign process of an Open Innovation in Science research project?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific strategies to manage power differentials and ensure meaningful participation of all stakeholders in the codesign process of an Open Innovation in Science research project.\n\n"}

Of course, disciplinary boundaries can vary and  not all affiliations were specified fully in the papers,  meaning that the reported numbers were in some  cases qualitative estimates. Still, accepting these clas- sifications and performing a slight aggregation, an  even split can be observed, following the traditional  division: education\/psychology (10), all natural  science (10). Interestingly, only four papers were  assessed to have representatives of both of these  traditions. It can be speculated that the field of game-  based creativity assessment has so far primarily been  investigated in relatively narrowly defined scientific  contexts. This could explain the generally low participation numbers reported above. Any long-  term, scalable creativity assessment game could  greatly benefit from in-depth interdisciplinary com - munication and collaboration.\n### Input: What does the even split between education\/psychology and all natural science in the coauthorship of the selected papers suggest about the field of game-based creativity assessment?\n### Response: The even split between education\/psychology and all natural science in the coauthorship of the selected papers suggests that the field of game-based creativity assessment has been investigated primarily within these specific scientific contexts. However, there has been limited interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, as evidenced by the low number of papers with representatives from both traditions. This could potentially limit the scope and applicability of the research in this field.\n\n"}

For example, scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) who perceived themselves as experts in their field experienced a crisis of their identity as heroic innovators and problem-solvers when experimenting with platform-based innovation challenges (Lifshitz-Assaf 2018 ). While some scientists were sceptical about working with non-experts, others were highly enthusiastic about the resulting breakthroughs. These scientists went through a process of transforming their identity to see themselves as solution-seekers instead of problem-solvers, thereby embracing open approaches. They were also found to have a more interdisciplinary career history, a factor that contributed to their ability to embrace such changes.\n### Input: What role does a scientist's professional identity play in their ability to adopt open and collaborative practices, as shown in the example of NASA scientists experimenting with platform-based innovation challenges?\n### Response: The scientist's professional identity plays a critical role in their ability to adopt open and collaborative practices. In the example of NASA scientists, those who perceived themselves as experts experienced a crisis of identity when experimenting with platform-based innovation challenges. However, those who were able to transform their identity to see themselves as solution-seekers instead of problem-solvers were more open to these practices. Additionally, having a more interdisciplinary career history also contributed to their ability to embrace such changes.\n\n"}

Association networks capture the relationships between concepts and words used in natural language (Beketayev & Runco, 2016 ). Acar and Runco (2014 ) use a semantic-based algorithm (SBA) to calculate how distant (in conceptual space) ideas or answers of an individual are from each other. They found that SBA flexibility is strongly correlated (r = 0.74) with traditional scoring of flexibility scores from the Many Uses Test (similar to the Alternative Uses Test; Guilford, 1968 ), suggesting strong convergent validity. While the approach holds potential, Forthmann, Oyebade, Ojo, G\u00fcnther, and Holling (2019 ) highlight that this system is susceptible to certain biases, which can taint the calculations of the system. It must also be noted that automated assessments are far from capturing the complexity and nuance of human judgment needed for some assessments such as scoring originality or flexibility of figural elements of the Torrance 30 J. RAFNER ET AL.\n### Input: What are some potential biases and limitations of using a semantic-based algorithm for assessing divergent thinking tasks, as highlighted by Forthmann, Oyebade, Ojo, G\u00fcnther, and Holling (2019)?\n### Response: The text does not provide specific details on the potential biases and limitations of using a semantic-based algorithm for assessing divergent thinking tasks as highlighted by Forthmann, Oyebade, Ojo, G\u00fcnther, and Holling (2019).\n\n"}

In the discussion below, we take the participant-centered view, defining the task as a single instance of a problem. Given the above definitions, we can already examine the relation of these categories to HI. Revisiting the HI criteria (collectiveness, solution superiority and mutual learning), we see that the category CS content or task selection does not meet the criteria of Collectiveness, since the AI is not working on the same task as the participants.\n### Input: What is the relationship between the category of CS content or task selection and the HI criteria of collectiveness?\n### Response: The category of CS content or task selection does not meet the HI criteria of collectiveness because the AI is not working on the same task as the participants.\n\n"}

Guilford\u2019s Alternate Uses Test (Guilford, 1968) asks participants to come up with alternative\/unusual uses of everyday objects, such as a brick, or a pencil. A widely used battery (i.e., collection of tests) is the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966), which includes a variety of verbal (e.g., Unusual Uses, Impossibilities, Consequences, Situations) and non-verbal tasks (Incomplete Figures, Creative Design, Circles and Squares). A similar, popular battery is the Wallach-Kogan Creativity Test (Wallach & Kogan, 1965), which includes three verbal, and two visual tasks.

This scheme contains only one connection (arrow f) and is usually done with data from multiple participants acquired over a period of time much longer than the single-task solution time, typically weeks or months, hence the name \u201ccollective level\u201d, which we visualise with a dash-dotted outline of a crowd. The model itself or its execution on unseen data then forms part of the CS task solution. This scheme is very convenient from the ML perspective, because the quantity and quality of participant data is often not known in advance. AI model architecture can be chosen accordingly (post-factum) in order to prevent overfitting (attributing meaning to noise in the data). This scheme is applied for example in Stall Catchers (Stall Catchers 2020), Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al. 2008), EyeWire (Kim et al. 2014), Quantum Moves 2 (Jensen et al. 2021), Eterna (Andreasson et al. 2019), Phylo (Kawrykow et al. 2012), and Fraxinus (Rallapalli et al. 2015).\n### Input: What is the Tier 1: Post-acquisition AI analysis, collective level scheme in Citizen Science and how is it applied in various projects?\n### Response: The Tier 1: Post-acquisition AI analysis, collective level scheme in Citizen Science (CS) involves training an AI model online using participant input acquired over a long period of time, typically weeks or months, without the use of AI during the data acquisition phase.

While early predictions of their transformative potential (e.g. Lynch 2003 ) proved overly optimistic, the passage of open access policies and the adoption of new service models have expanded researcher participation (Dubinsky 2014 ). More recently, research organisations have also sought to configure physical spaces like FabLabs to empower communities and work towards solving societal problems (Dorland, Clausen, and J\u00f8rgensen 2019 ). However, since these infrastructures are generally cost centres that do not directly produce revenue, their ongoing viability likely depends on a widely perceived alignment with organisational mission.\n### Input: What factors have contributed to the increased participation of researchers in library-managed institutional repositories and how do these infrastructures align with the organisational mission of research organisations?\n### Response: The increased participation of researchers in library-managed institutional repositories has been influenced by the passage of open access policies and the adoption of new service models, as per the text.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: Additionally, digital games enable higher engagement  levels. This could allow for longer interactions and multi - faceted testing of creativity in a complex environment,  which is necessary to elicit and assess both creative pro- cesses and products, without inducing testing fatigue.  This point is paramount in creativity research, as more  and more emphasis is placed on the inclusion of multiple  domains and tasks, in order to adequately make general - izations about an individual\u2019s creativity. Digital games  also afford the ability to capture detailed, fine grained  steps in an individual\u2019s trajectory toward an output  (Hart et al., 2017 ). Given their accessibility, appeal and  prevalence in peoples\u2019 everyday lives (Ghuman &  Griffiths, 2012 ) digital games could allow for broader  sampling (engaging many demographic groups), possibly  leading to reliable predictions at the individual level  (through validation of demographically fine-grained  models), higher external validity, and more generalizable  results. On the one hand, if the games are freely accessible  online, there are several risk factors from lack of research  supervision such as people playing without paying atten - tion. On the other hand, freely accessible digital games  could support the equitable access to creativity assess - ment. These factors underscore the potential digital  games hold for assessing creativity.\n### Input: What potential do digital games hold for assessing creativity and how can they contribute to higher engagement levels and more generalizable results in creativity research?\n### Response: Digital games hold significant potential for assessing creativity by enabling higher engagement levels, allowing for longer interactions, and facilitating multi-faceted testing of creativity in a complex environment. They can capture detailed, fine-grained steps in an individual's trajectory toward an output, which can be crucial in creativity research. Digital games' accessibility, appeal, and prevalence in everyday lives could allow for broader sampling, engaging many demographic groups, and possibly leading to reliable predictions at the individual level. This could result in higher external validity and more generalizable results. Furthermore, if these games are freely accessible online, they could support equitable access to creativity assessment. However, the lack of research supervision could pose several risk factors, such as people playing without paying attention.\n\n"}

The general public as co-creator in the scientific research process. Historically,  the public understanding of science (Durant, Evans, and Thomas 1989 ) considered  scientists as bearers of knowledge and \u2018lay\u2019 citizens as recipients of a scientific education.  More recently, a more democratised model has emerged, in which the public is engaged  with science in a variety of ways. For example, in medicine, deeper interactions between  scientists and patients have increased the motivation of scientists to engage in innovation  activities (Llopis and D\u2019Este 2016 ). Today, members of the public can co-create and  disseminate scientific research through practices such as citizen science or crowd science.  Although these practices are marked by some particularities (e.g. level and stage of  engagement), they have many similar elements (e.g. sourcing external knowledge).  Both can be considered promising approaches to organising science in that they increase  the scope of problems under investigation and multiply types of potential participants.\n### Input: What are some ways in which the general public can engage in the scientific research process and contribute to scientific innovation?\n### Response: The general public can engage in the scientific research process and contribute to scientific innovation through practices such as citizen science or crowd science. These practices allow members of the public to co-create and disseminate scientific research. In medicine, for example, deeper interactions between scientists and patients have increased the motivation of scientists to engage in innovation activities.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: The fitness-distance correlation coefficient allows Jones and Forrest [53] to distinguish between three classes of landscapes: The first is straightforward, for \u03c1 FDC \u2264\u22120.15. This is the ideal case, where the closer a solver gets to the global optimum, the higher the fitness is. These cases are roughly correspondent to \u201csmooth\u201d landscapes. NK problems where K\u22643 fall in this category. The second is difficult, for \u22120.15<\u03c1 FDC<0.15. There is limited correlation between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution. This makes such optimization problems very hard to solve and renders the search heuristics to random search. According to Jones and Forrest [53], as K increases over 3, NK landscapes quickly become uncorrelated and \u03c1 FDC approaches 0. These are \u201crugged\u201d landscapes, with limited or uncorrelated ruggedness.\n### Input: What does the fitness-distance correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution in different classes of landscapes?\n### Response: The fitness-distance correlation coefficient indicates the relationship between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution in different classes of landscapes. In straightforward landscapes (\u03c1 FDC \u2264\u22120.15), there is a strong correlation where the closer a solver gets to the global optimum, the higher the fitness is. These are typically \"smooth\" landscapes. In difficult landscapes (\u22120.15<\u03c1 FDC<0.15), there is limited correlation between the fitness difference and the distance to the optimal solution, making these optimization problems hard to solve. These are typically \"rugged\" landscapes with limited or uncorrelated ruggedness.\n\n"}

Assessment in these environments is called  stealth assessment , where the player\u2019s in-game actions  are continually logged, while the participant is immersed  in the activity, without being constantly attune to the  assessment. Stealth assessment is rooted in evidence cen- tered design (Mislevy, Almond, & Lukas, 2003 ), which  combines knowledge from both computational, and con- ceptual models. This method requires the researcher to  \u201c(a) define the claims concerning learners\u2019 competencies,  (b) establish what represents valid evidence of a claim, and  (c) determine the kind of tasks or situations that will elicit  that evidence \u201d (Shute & Kim, 2014 , p. 107). Stealth assess - ment systems use two main processes, which incorporate  the requisites of evidence centered design. These are evi- dence identification (i.e., identifying the predefined vari- ables or observables from log files), and evidence  accumulation (i.e., statistically linking the observables to  the facets of the competency at hand), which allow for the  assessment of the player\u2019s competency level in real-time.  Assuming that the underlying theory is robust, the more  data the players generate, the more accurate the estimate  for each player becomes. Additionally, the fine-grained  tracking and recording of player\u2019s interactions (i.e., via the  accumulation of log data generated by keystrokes, mouse  clicks, and choice patterns) can be used to analyze the  player\u2019s learning progress and provide ongoing feedback  (Shute, Lu, & Rahimi, 2021 ).\n### Input: What are the two main processes used in stealth assessment systems and how do they contribute to the assessment of a player's competency level in real-time?\n### Response: The two main processes used in stealth assessment systems are evidence identification and evidence accumulation. Evidence identification involves identifying the predefined variables or observables from log files. Evidence accumulation, on the other hand, involves statistically linking the observables to the facets of the competency at hand. These processes allow for the assessment of the player\u2019s competency level in real-time. As the players generate more data, the estimate for each player becomes more accurate. The fine-grained tracking and recording of player\u2019s interactions can be used to analyze the player\u2019s learning progress and provide ongoing feedback.\n\n"}

To further understand the type of support needed and thereby the choice of AI, we also explore a second CS task characteristic: accessibility to contribution, which we elaborate on below. Note, even though a task may routinely be solved by participants, it should not be taken as a sign of computational simplicity, since tasks easily completed by humans (e.g., pattern recognition) can be quite challenging for AI. This CS task mapping may lead to increased appreciation of the multitude of human-processing going on in CS projects that are still far from being automatable in any foreseeable future.\n### Input: What is the relationship between the degree of digitization, the choice of AI, and the accessibility to contribution in citizen science tasks?\n### Response: The degree of digitization is closely related to the choice of AI to optimally support participants in solving citizen science tasks. The type of support needed, and thereby the choice of AI, is also influenced by the accessibility to contribution, another characteristic of citizen science tasks. However, the text also notes that tasks easily completed by humans should not be assumed to be computationally simple for AI.\n\n"}

The player must place a tile in an empty spot adjacent to the edge of another tile. However, the shape must always be continuous so they can only move tiles at the edges of the shape so that any other tile does not end up \u2018by itself\u2019 (Fig 1, left). tiles is based on the Creative Foraging game [ 11\u201313], which was designed to study creative exploration processes. In tiles, players complete a tutorial which introduces them to the basic game mechanics and features then proceed through the three modes. The DT mode has three levels. Players are instructed to create and save at least five different digit\/dog\/animal-like shapes within 4 minutes for each level. At the end of each level, the participants can see the shapes they have saved in their personal gallery (Fig 1, middle). After completing three tasks, players view two shapes at a time, which are randomly selected from the database of submitted shapes, and are asked to rate on a five point likert-scale how similar the two shapes are. They are required to rate at least five pairs before progressing to the next mode. In the CT mode players are presented with a targetfigure and four possible starting figures (Fig 1, right). The objective is to select the best starting shape and rearrange it into the target shape in the fewest possible number of steps. There is only one best choice. Participants have 30 seconds to choose a starting shape and one minute to recreate the target shape. Players must solve 6 challenges with increasing difficulty (two easy, two medium, and two hard). In the free play mode players are instructed to make \u2018the most creative shapes you can think of\u2019 and to \u2018save at least 5 different shapes\u2019 with in 4 minutes. Players are then instructed to pick the three shapes they think are most creative from their saved shapes. After that, they are shown pairs of figures side by side and are asked to pick the more creative one. \n### Input: What is the objective of the CT mode in the game Tiles?\n### Response: The objective of the CT mode in the game Tiles is to select the best starting shape and rearrange it into the target shape in the fewest possible number of steps.\n\n"}

However, the effectiveness of these approaches depends on the types of factors noted, such that open and collaborative approaches may not be suitable for every scientific undertaking. Third, OIS-based outcomes can ensue along the entire scientific research process (e.g. proposals, datasets, protocols, code, publications, patents, teaching materials, science-based innovations). These outcomes may have scientific and societal impacts , such as an accelerated response to novel diseases.2 Those impacts also 2For example, consider the role of open and collaborative practices in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. A groundswell of scientific knowledge-sharing across disciplinary, organisational, and national boundaries allowed for rapid and coordinated progress to be made (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick 2020 ). Preprint servers like bioRxiv and medRxiv allowed researchers to report and evaluate findings quickly, while more than thirty scientific publishers agreed to make selected publications openly accessible for the duration of the crisis. And while do-it-yourself efforts to address shortages of medical devices and supplies were stymied at times by a lack of understanding of clinical needs (Zastrow 2020 ), these efforts to \u2018hack the crisis\u2019 also revealed societal reserves of insight and generosity that the science system has yet to fully tap.140  S.

They can also lead to outcomes along the entire scientific research process, such as proposals, datasets, protocols, code, publications, patents, teaching materials, and science-based innovations. These outcomes can have scientific and societal impacts, such as an accelerated response to novel diseases. An example given is the role of open and collaborative practices in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, where knowledge-sharing allowed for rapid and coordinated progress. \n\nHowever, the text also notes that the effectiveness of these approaches depends on certain factors, and they may not be suitable for every scientific undertaking.

By designing a complete game from scratch around spe-ci\ufb01c cognitive abilities, researchers can obtain richer information than the traditional penand paper version (Hagler, Jimison, & Pavel, 2014). The games can be more complex anddynamic, which allows for more interesting cognitive modeling (Leduc-McNiven, White,Zheng, D McLeod, & R Friesen, 2018). Moreover, cognitive assessment games often applystealth assessment(Shute, Wang, Greiff, Zhao, & Moore, 2016), where the cognitive abilitymeasures are derived from the players\u2019 in-game behavior. Thus, the players are immersed inthe game experience rather than being constantly aware of being tested (Shute et al., 2016;Valladares-Rodr\u00edguez, P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez, Anido-Rif\u00f3n, & Fern\u00e1ndez-Iglesias, 2016).\n### Input: What is the advantage of using cognitive assessment games designed through an evidence-centered design process over traditional pen and paper methods?\n### Response: The advantage of using cognitive assessment games designed through an evidence-centered design process over traditional pen and paper methods is that they can provide richer information. These games can be more complex and dynamic, allowing for more interesting cognitive modeling. They often apply stealth assessment, where the cognitive ability measures are derived from the players\u2019 in-game behavior.

To date, well-known CS typologies have focused on participant contributions to different parts of the research process such as collecting data (Bonney et al. 2009b, 2016, Paul et al. 2014), forming hypotheses (e.g. Bonney et al. 2009a, Haklay 2013), or generating knowledge in the project (Sch\u00e4fer and Kieslinger 2016). Wiggins & Crowston (2011) were the first to take into account what they termed \u2018virtuality\u2019, i.e. digitization, in which projects are characterized as either online or offline. As nearly all CS projects trend towards including some digital components, in the following we show how adding granularity to the degree of digitization lends valuable insights into the potential forms of human-machine interactions in CS tasks.\n### Input: What role does the degree of digitization play in determining the potential forms of human-machine interactions in Citizen Science tasks?\n### Response: The degree of digitization in Citizen Science tasks plays a significant role in determining the potential forms of human-machine interactions. As most Citizen Science projects are trending towards including some digital components, understanding the level of digitization can provide valuable insights into how humans and machines can interact within these tasks. This could influence the type of machine support that is ideally suited for different tasks.\n\n"}

Team- and group-level antecedents and boundary conditions This section outlines some exemplary team- and group-level antecedents (i.e. drivers and barriers) and contingencies for (successfully) applying OIS mechanisms. These factors are grouped in terms of a) team or group composition and roles, and b) peer effects. While we acknowledge disciplinary differences around how social entities comprised of multiple researchers are described and organised (e.g. team, group, lab), we refer to teams as networks of individuals with a shared responsibility for performing interdependent tasks that have definite start and end points (i.e. when goals are achieved). Research groups are a more durable structure characterised by the leadership of a principal investigator, in which the group members\u2019 tasks can be independent from each other and training is often an important function.150 S.

Future research also needs to advance our understanding of the multi-level antecedents  and contingencies of OIS practices that influence the occurrence and success of open and  collaborative practices in science. At the individual level, as discussed above, capabilities  such as creativity have been found to influence open and collaborative behaviour, but less is  known about how to build such capabilities at an early career stage or even during child - hood (e.g. as a form of individual-level absorptive capacity).

In general, remuneration is primarily intended to compensate participants for working time, traveling, invested resources, etc. (see for example the 2019 Guideline from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA 2019) on \u201cWorking together with patients\u201d). This is typically a one-time payment though. A second approach to encouraging data sharing is to provide prioritized access to medical technology or therapies (when available) for individual patients and participants who previously shared data for the study. But it might also raise ethical concerns if access to scarce technology or therapies is not primarily based on the medical needs of the patients. \n### Input: What ethical concerns might arise if access to scarce medical technology or therapies is given based on participation in clinical trials rather than the medical needs of the patients?\n### Response: The text suggests that ethical concerns might arise if access to scarce medical technology or therapies is given based on participation in clinical trials rather than the medical needs of the patients because it could potentially prioritize those who have participated in trials over those who may have a greater medical need. This could lead to an unfair distribution of resources, potentially disadvantaging those who are in greater need but have not participated in clinical trials.\n\n"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction: Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question.\n\nText: The diagrams in Fig. 3 show how information is passed between the different agents when solving the CS task. The CS task is an abstract object representing both the scientific challenge and the scientists (e.g., the tasks might be dynamically updated). Note that the notion of a task may contain some ambiguity. For instance, in an annotation tasks one can either consider \"annotation of a single element\" or of \"the set of elements\" as the fundamental \"task\". Of course, for the researchers the task is the latter, but for the participant it is arguably the former. Thus task selection in the former frame would be called task assistance in the latter frame. Here we define tasks from the perspective of the participants. The task can also represent the physical environment which the participants may be in direct contact with (arrow h), such as when the participants take pictures of nature for the iNaturalist project (part of the scientific challenge). The arrow h could also represent a previously acquired experience on the matter, for example a general knowledge of shapes required for contributing to the Galaxy Zoo project. The presence and character of the arrow h distinguishes between the different degrees of task digitization in the individual projects, as discussed previously (see Figure 2). In projects with a high degree of digitization, the information flow through this channel is reduced or even absent, as the CS task can be fully represented by the Online solution algorithm (defined below), simply put, the participants do not need \u201ccontact with the physical world\u201d to solve the task.\n### Input: What does the arrow h represent in the context of the CS task diagram in Fig. 3?\n### Response: The arrow h in the context of the CS task diagram in Fig. 3 represents the direct contact participants may have with the physical environment when solving the task. It could also represent a previously acquired experience or knowledge on the matter. The presence and character of arrow h distinguishes between the different degrees of task digitization in the individual projects.\n\n"}

The player is instructed not to react to red rats but to still tap all other rats as quickly as possible. The level then follows the same progression as the \ufb01rst level, ending after three errors have been made (either tapping a red rat or not tapping the other rats before the timer runs out). This taps into choice reaction time and response inhibition. Further, Rat Catch levels add variations, such as an increasing number of stimuli or moving targets that have no analog in the Go\/No-Go task. These additions give indicators of visuospatial reasoning components, such as 2D spatial representation and movement perception. \n### Input: What skills does the second level of the game test in a player?\n### Response: The second level of the game tests a player's choice reaction time, response inhibition, visuospatial reasoning components, 2D spatial representation, and movement perception.\n\n"}

First, most of the models used in participant modeling  efforts are neural networks generated using deep or reinforcement learning methods. These  methods are efficient and can fit a model with little prior knowledge about the subject [19, 20].  But they are susceptible to overfitting and spurious effects, and because of their lack of  explainability this is difficult to detect. Additionally, these models are generally very specific.  They answer very precise questions and focus on only one parameter that they try to predict, for  example, when is the best time to display a motivational message. These models cannot easily be  used for other purposes. Finally, these models are highly dependent on the quantity of data  available, thus limiting the number of small projects that can use these  models.\n### Input: What are the limitations of using neural networks generated using deep or reinforcement learning methods to understand player engagement in citizen science games?\n### Response: The limitations of using neural networks generated using deep or reinforcement learning methods to understand player engagement in citizen science games include susceptibility to overfitting and spurious effects, lack of explainability which makes it difficult to detect these issues, specificity of the models which limits their applicability for other purposes, and high dependence on the quantity of data available, which restricts the number of small projects that can use these models.\n\n"}

Motivation refers to the process whereby goal-directed activities are instigated and sustained by intrinsic or extrinsic dynamics (Lepper et al., 1973; Lieb eroth et al., 2014; Ryan & Deci, 2000). Intrinsic motivation refers to motivation to engage in an activity for its own sake. When students are intrinsically motivated, they work on tasks because they enjoy the activity and find it meanin gful. In contrast, extrinsic motivation is based on other reasons, such as outside demands or economic and symbolic rewards (Ryan & Deci, 2000). In most cases learning trajectories are supported by a little bit of both. Since intrinsic motivation is thought to have a positive impact on students (Deci et al., 1991), the potential relationship between high levels of intrinsic motivation and higher levels of performance in DiffGame is examined.\n### Input: What is the potential relationship between high levels of intrinsic motivation and higher levels of performance in DiffGame?\n### Response: The text suggests that there might be a positive relationship between high levels of intrinsic motivation and higher levels of performance in DiffGame.\n\n"}

As shown above, the main factor is responsible for explaining a high percentage of variance for both games and validation tasks. Therefore, in order to demonstrate that our model has discriminative power beyond being driven by the main factor, we computed partial correlations between the games and validation tasks while controlling for the games\u2019 main factor. These partial correlations thus reveal the extent to which our models can predict the nuances contained within each separate cognitive ability that goes beyond a generalized cognitive ability. Fig. 7 illustrates the fraction of the correlation between the task and the game-based measures that is not explained by the main factor. For all eight cognitive models, we find that 23\u201363% of the correlation is not due to the main factor, demonstrating the discriminative validity of the models. In other words, we clearly document that each of our models tap significantly into aspects beyond just the general abilities factor.\n### Input: What does the fraction of the correlation between the task and the game-based measures that is not explained by the main factor indicate about the discriminative validity of the cognitive models?\n### Response: The fraction of the correlation between the task and the game-based measures that is not explained by the main factor indicates that the cognitive models have discriminative validity.

By making explicit assumptions about individual or organizational behavior and the environment in which the agent evolves, researchers could now simulate how such agents adapt over time. As in the study of genes in biology, this allows one to map the complex dynamics of agents being embedded in and adapting to the competitive environment [8, 16\u201320]. In the NK model, all the positions x in the fitness landscape belong to an N-dimensional space where the value along each of the dimensions can take the value of 0 or 1, i.e., x \u2208 0,1{ } N, (1) representing whether attributes of genes are active or not. The neighborhood size parameter K determines the level of inter-dependency among the dimensions when evaluating the fitness value f(x). Thus, in order to evaluate the fitness value for x you compute the value of the N\u00b72 K+1 given local fitness functions: f i(x) = fixi;xi1,. . ., xiK, (2) where x i1,. . ., xiK are the values of the K successive neighbors to the ith dimension. The neighbors are taken in a cyclic manner; e.g., for K=3 neighbors to x N\u22121 would be xN,x1,and x 2. The fitness value of x is then the average of the local fitness functions: f(x) = 1N Ni=1 fi(x). (3) For an example of N=3,K=1 landscape with the local fitness functions could be f 1(00) =0,f 1(01) =0.64,f 1(10) =1,f 1(11) =0.75, (4) f 2(00) =0.80,f 2(01) =0.14,f 2(10) =0.42,f 2(11) =0.91, (5) f 3(00) =0.79,f 3(01) =0.95,f 3(10) =66,f 3(11) =0.04. (6) The fitness value of x=110 would be f(110) = 1\/3f 1(11) +f2(10) +f3(01) = 1\/3(0.75+0.42+0.95) =0.71. (7) For further details on how the NK landscape is computed, see Ganco and Hoetker [10].\n### Input: What is the NK model and how is the fitness value calculated in this model?\n### Response: The NK model is a method used to simulate how individual or organizational agents adapt over time in a competitive environment. In this model, all positions x in the fitness landscape belong to an N-dimensional space where the value along each dimension can take the value of 0 or 1, representing whether attributes of genes are active or not. The neighborhood size parameter K determines the level of inter-dependency among the dimensions when evaluating the fitness value f(x). \n\nThe fitness value for x is computed by calculating the value of the N\u00b72 K+1 given local fitness functions. These local fitness functions are represented as f i(x) = fixi;xi1,. . ., xiK, where x i1,. . ., xiK are the values of the K successive neighbors to the ith dimension.

Such processes can result in modified funding calls, evaluation  guidelines, or, in rare cases, even a decision not to pursue a given line of inquiry: consider  the bans at various levels of governance on human cloning research, some of which were  informed by processes of public consultation. These outcomes, in turn, can feed into the  composition of diverse research teams and the co-development of research proposals  that, in both substance and format, differ from those initiated by scientists alone  (Williams et al. 2010 ). Even as elements of research design like the selection of methods  can be considered outcomes of collaboration, open lab notebooks and platforms like  protocols.io also facilitate the sharing of research instruments and tacit knowledge about  their use.

One might naively expect that the pinnacle of human contribution is to solve complex mathematical problems (high degree of digitization tasks). However, in many ways the robotics\/smart sensors capable of assisting or replacing human volunteers in the real world for physical tasks is a much more difficult problem, considering current robotics are comparably less advanced than the state-of-the-art RL technologies (Vinyals et al. 2019, Dalgaard et al. 2020). This clearly demonstrates that the degree of digitization should not be mistaken for an axis of increasing cognitive complexity. We therefore posit that a systematic comparison with modern computational capabilities will lead to increased understanding and appreciation of the multitudes of tasks that human volunteers perform, and how that labor works alongside technology and ML.\n### Input: What does the degree of digitization indicate about the complexity of tasks performed by human volunteers and how can a systematic comparison with modern computational capabilities enhance our understanding of this?\n### Response: The degree of digitization does not necessarily indicate an increase in cognitive complexity of tasks performed by human volunteers. While one might assume that solving complex mathematical problems (highly digitized tasks) represents the peak of human contribution, the text suggests that physical tasks assisted or replaced by robotics\/smart sensors (less digitized tasks) can be more challenging, given the current state of robotics technology. A systematic comparison with modern computational capabilities can enhance our understanding of this by highlighting the range of tasks that human volunteers perform and how their labor interacts with technology and machine learning. This comparison can also help identify areas where technology is less advanced and where human contribution is still crucial.\n\n"}
