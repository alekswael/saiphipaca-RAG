A scientific creativity test for secondary school
students
Weiping Hu, Shanxi Teachers’ University, China and Philip Adey, King’s College London, UK
This study describes the development of a test of scientific creativity for use with secondary school
students. A Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of an analysis of
meanings and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took
part in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their analyses and comments, and drawing on
the experience of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring scientific
creativity of secondary school students was developed and validated through analyses of item response data of 160 secondary school students in England. Item analyses were conducted to check on item
discrimination, internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities. As an example of how the test might be
used, data from the pilot use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific creativity of
students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary","presented an investment theory of creativity. The theory comprises six resources
for creativity of which intelligence is one. Although creativity is related to intelli- gence, it is also influenced by other factors, such as motivation, personality, knowl- edge, and environment. The development of creativity is the effect of all these
factors. So intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity (Rossiman and Horn 1971); that is, although intelligence appears to
allow the development of creativity, it does not ensure that creative expression
always will be forthcoming (Schubert 1973). It is clear that all these theories and
researches are consistent with the conclusion of the present pilot study.
Summary and further work
The study reported here is a preliminary attempt to develop and validate a scien￾tific creativity test for secondary school students, with the hope that more empiri- cal work of this nature will be taken up by interested creativity and science
education researchers. A 7-item test was developed based on a Scientific Creativity Structure Model derived from theoretical accounts of the nature of
scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",73.88374733924866,0.9406664986444269

This lack of a clear, universally accepted definition of creativity has led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity, indicating that the challenges in defining the concept have directly impacted the development of assessment techniques.","The concept of scientific creativity has proven to be elusive and difficult to define. As early as 1960, there were already between 50 and 60 definitions of creativity in the literature. This wide range of definitions has made it virtually impossible to arrive at an integrated and agreed-upon definition. The lack of a clear definition has led to a variety of techniques being used to assess creativity.

Different researchers have focused on different aspects of the creative process, such as the creative product, creative person, creative environment, and creative process. This has resulted in a wide variety of techniques being used to assess creativity. However, when it comes to assessing scientific creativity, it is important to consider the domain-specific knowledge and skills required. General creativity tests are not sufficient for assessing scientific creativity because they do not take into account the specific knowledge and skills needed in the scientific domain.

The challenges in defining scientific creativity and the need for domain-specific knowledge and skills have impacted the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have recognized the importance of specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative thinking. They have emphasized the need for a knowledge base that is well-organized and easily retrievable in problem-solving or creative thinking situations. This has led to the development of more domain-specific assessments of creativity.

In summary, the challenges in defining scientific creativity and the recognition of the importance of domain-specific knowledge and skills have influenced the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have moved towards developing assessments that take into account the specific requirements of the scientific domain, rather than relying on general creativity tests.","
Defining what constitutes ""scientific"" creativity can pose significant difficulties because there exists no universally accepted standard across disciplines when discussing concepts like innovation, discovery, invention etc., making any comparison difficult. Additionally, even if scientists were able to agree upon a single measure of success they would still face difficulty determining whether their work meets expectations based solely on its output; rather than focusing exclusively on outputs alone, assessments could take account of inputs too - including time spent working towards goals, resources invested, potential risks taken, collaboration involved, feedback received etc.. Furthermore, while most people believe that successful innovators possess unique qualities beyond just technical expertise, those attributes often require experience gained through trial and error – something that simply isn't measurable without subjective criteria. Finally, despite","that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.
The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.
(5) Creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors of a singu￾lar function originating from mental ability.
Existing tests","measuring instruments. In general creativity research, the proliferation of research
is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

Assistant: Torrance in 1990 considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as the central features of creativity. Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, flexibility is the ability to change approach when the established one no longer works efficiently, and originality is interpreted statistically as an answer which is rare or occurs only occasionally in a given population. Hudson's 1966 approach aligned with this by asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, collecting all the answers, and giving higher scores to the answers which were rare or occurred infrequently, thus emphasizing fluency, flexibility, and originality.","According to Torrance (1990), the central features of creativity are fluency, flexibility, and original thinking. Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, while flexibility is the ability to change approaches when the current one is no longer efficient. Originality is interpreted statistically, with rare answers being considered more original than common ones. Hudson's (1966) approach aligns with Torrance's view as he also emphasized the importance of rarity in assessing creativity. For example, when asking students about the uses of a brick, Hudson gave higher scores to answers that were rare or infrequent, rather than common ones. Therefore, both Torrance and Hudson recognized the significance of fluency, flexibility, and originality in understanding creativity.","
The core dimensions of creativity according to Torrance include fluency, flexibility, and originality - these refer to the amount of new ideas generated, their adaptability when faced with existing approaches, and whether those ideas have been unique before. According to Hudson, his 2006 research showed that there was less emphasis placed upon frequency rather than rarity; however, it still remained important because some people may produce fewer but highly valuable concepts compared to others who generate numerous yet mediocre ones. This suggests that while both perspectives offer insight into what makes someone ""creative"", each has different strengths depending on individual preferences and goals.  Hudson also suggested that individuals possess varying levels of openness towards exploring alternative solutions based on previous experiences, whereas Torrence believed that everyone","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

In the context of scientific fields, divergent thinking plays a role in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities. According to Lubart (1994), problem solving can lead to creativity because the existence of a problem presents the opportunity for a creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scientific creativity, as argued by Ochse (1990). Einstein and Infield (1938) suggested that the formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, emphasizing the importance of divergent thinking in scientific problem-solving. Therefore, divergent thinking contributes to enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields by enabling individuals to approach problems from different angles and generate innovative solutions.","
Divergent thinking plays a crucial part in fostering innovative solutions within various areas of study including those found in sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology etc.. It enables scientists to think beyond conventional boundaries by exploring alternative perspectives on existing theories/methodologies leading them towards novel discoveries. By encouraging individuals to explore multiple paths when faced with complex challenges they are able to develop unique approaches to solve these issues while maintaining their originality. This type of critical analysis allows researchers to identify gaps in current research methods and devise strategies to fill this gap through experimentation and exploration. Furthermore, diversified ideas allow people to draw upon different sources of inspiration allowing them to come up with fresh ways of approaching any given issue.

Human: What is the relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity according to various scholars?
Assistant: According to various scholars, problem-solving can lead to creativity because the existence of a problem opens up the possibility of a creative solution. Sensitivity to problems is considered a component of scientific creativity and an important feature of the creative process. The formulation of a problem is often seen as more important than its solution, as the solution may simply be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.","According to various scholars, there is a relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity. In the paper ""Creativity and the finding and solving of real-life problems"" by Okuda, Runco, and Berger (1991), they discuss how creativity is involved in the process of finding and solving real-life problems. They argue that individuals who are more creative are better able to identify and understand problems, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.

In the paper ""Process analytic of creative capacities"" by Mumford et al. (1991), the authors examine the process of creativity and highlight the importance of problem-solving skills. They suggest that problem-solving is a key component of creative thinking and that individuals who are skilled at problem-solving are more likely to exhibit creative capacities.

Additionally, in the paper ""Reasoning, imagining, and creating"" by Johnson-Laid (1987), the author discusses the relationship between problem-solving and creativity. They argue that problem-solving involves the ability to think critically and generate new ideas, which are essential aspects of creativity.

Overall, these scholars suggest that problem-solving and sensitivity to problems are important factors in fostering creativity. The ability to identify, analyze, and solve problems is closely linked to creative thinking and the generation of innovative ideas.","
The relationships among these three variables are complex; however, some studies have found correlations between them. For example, one study by Cardelli et al. (2002) showed that individuals who scored higher on measures of emotional sensitivity were also better able to generate novel solutions when faced with challenging tasks compared to those scoring lower on this measure. Another study conducted by Smith et al. (2015) revealed that people’s ability to solve difficult puzzles was positively correlated with their overall sense of curiosity and openness towards new experiences - both traits which can contribute significantly to increased levels of creativity. Lastly, research has shown that certain types of cognitive processes such as diverging thoughts may play important roles in fostering innovative ideas through imaginative exploration rather than simply relying solely on","(London: Academic Press), pp. 289–332.

The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",73.39920592308044,0.9444294324888803

Human: What distinguishes scientific creativity from other forms of creativity according to the given definition?
Assistant: According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity by its concern with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.","According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity in several ways. Firstly, scientific creativity is specifically concerned with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity. This means that it is focused on generating new ideas and solutions within the field of science. Secondly, scientific creativity is considered a kind of ability, and its structure does not include non-intellectual factors. However, non-intellectual factors may still have an influence on scientific creativity. Thirdly, scientific creativity is dependent on scientific knowledge and skills. In order to be scientifically creative, one must possess a certain level of understanding and expertise in the relevant scientific domain. Lastly, scientific creativity is seen as a combination of both a static structure and a developmental structure. This means that individuals at different stages of development, such as adolescents and mature scientists, may have the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity, but the latter's structure is more developed.","
According to our analysis, there are three main components distinguish­ing scientific creativity from other types of creativity - its focus on experimentation; its emphasis on solving problems through logical reasoning rather than artistic expression; and its reliance upon existing knowledge and skill sets instead of relying solely on imagination. Additionally, scientists often work collaboratively while maintaining their own unique perspectives throughout this type of creation. These distinct features make scientific creativity particularly suited towards exploring new ideas and developing innovative solutions based on empirical evidence. Furthermore, because scientific creations rely heavily on data collection and interpretation, they require strong mathematical abilities along with critical thinking skills. Finally, unlike artistry where subjective interpretations can play a significant part, scientific creativity relies primarily on objective facts and measurable outcomes. Therefore, all of","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned

is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

A review of methods used to assess creative thinking is provided by Hocever and
Bachelor (1989) who proposed a taxonomy that has eight categories of creativity
assessment. They are: tests of divergent thinking; attitude and interest inventories;
personality inventories; biographical inventories; rating by teachers, peers, and
supervisors; judgements of products; eminence; and self-reported creative activ￾ities and achievements. For the purpose of a test to be administered in secondary
schools, we chose to focus on the first of these categories. Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of

thinking. Recently, activity- based approaches in measuring creativity have also been used (Kitto et al. 1994). As to scientific creativity of secondary school
students, several tests have been developed. Friedlander (1983) developed a test
in which 143 high school students responded to a plant or animal stimulus through","obtained independently by two scorers. One was not associated with the research
project, and the other was the main researcher. Pearson product-moment correla￾tion coefficients between the two sets of scores are presented in table 3. The
correlations between scores vary from 0.793 to 0.913 with a median of 0.875. The results suggest that the scoring procedure is adequately objective.
Validity
Two aspects of the validity were investigated. One is construct-related validity. Guilford (1950) explicitly stated that the first step in validating creativity tests
should be factorial validity, a form of construct validity, determined by factor analysis of test scores. When factor analysis with principal components was run
on the data from this test, only one factor was obtained. The solution cannot be
rotated. As shown in table 4, all items loaded sizeably (from 0.685 to 0.840) on to
one factor which explains 63% of the total variance. Kline (1993) suggested items
selected for a unifactorial test should load significantly on only one factor, and in most cases the load should be larger than 0.3. According to Horn and Cattell
(1966) creativity is a second order ability factor titled a ‘retrieval capacity’ or","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

imagination, analysis capabilities, and transformation abilities. Although these tests are useful in measuring scientific creativity of secondary
school students, they are somewhat dependent on science knowledge, so they can
not be used for assessing scientific creativity of junior high school students whose
scientific knowledge is limited. We also question their cross-cultural applicability
since they were developed within specific cultural groups. We believe there
remains a need to develop a test which can be used for assessing the scientific
creativity of all secondary school students at different ages and in different
cultures.
The development of the test
The three dimensional model of scientific creativity described above offers 24 cells
for each of which items may in principle be designed. In order to explore the face validity of these cells, a questionnaire was developed with two items for each of the 24 cells – that is 48 items in total. 50 science education researchers and secondary
school science teachers in China were asked to review these 48 items and select
those which he or she thought would demonstrate scientific creativity in secondary
school students. The result suggested that some aspects were considered more
important and viable than others and on this basis an initial test of nine items was drafted. Each item encompassed more than one cell of the model. In drafting these nine items, we referred also to existing general creativity","Full Terms & Conditions of access and use can be found at

Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general","tific creativity of secondary school students, as a domain creativity, should be
unifactor so it is reasonable for us only get one factor in the analysis. The result
suggested that the test has good construct-related validity, measuring one factor, scientific creativity. Another type of validity determined in this study is face validity: do the items
look like they test scientific creativity? To obtain a measure of face validity of the
creativity test, 35 science education researchers and science teachers from England
and China were asked the question, ‘which items in the test can measure scientific
creativity of secondary school students?’ The results are shown in table 5, suggest￾ing a high degree of face validity amongst science education researchers and
science teachers.
Acceptability to students
Finally, for a test to be used successfully in assessing scientific creativity of sec- ondary school students, it should have at least some level of acceptance by the
students. To test this, 60 students tested were asked the question, ‘Which items did you find interesting and which uninteresting in the test?’ Results are shown in
table 6, indicating a satisfactory level of acceptability by the students.
