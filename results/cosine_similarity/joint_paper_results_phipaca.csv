This study describes the development of a test of scientific creativity for use with secondary school
students. A Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of an analysis of
meanings and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took
part in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their analyses and comments, and drawing on
the experience of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring scientific
creativity of secondary school students was developed and validated through analyses of item response data of 160 secondary school students in England. Item analyses were conducted to check on item
discrimination, internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities. As an example of how the test might be
used, data from the pilot use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific creativity of
students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary","presented an investment theory of creativity. The theory comprises six resources
for creativity of which intelligence is one. Although creativity is related to intelli- gence, it is also influenced by other factors, such as motivation, personality, knowl- edge, and environment. The development of creativity is the effect of all these
factors. So intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity (Rossiman and Horn 1971); that is, although intelligence appears to
allow the development of creativity, it does not ensure that creative expression
always will be forthcoming (Schubert 1973). It is clear that all these theories and
researches are consistent with the conclusion of the present pilot study.
Summary and further work
The study reported here is a preliminary attempt to develop and validate a scien￾tific creativity test for secondary school students, with the hope that more empiri- cal work of this nature will be taken up by interested creativity and science
education researchers. A 7-item test was developed based on a Scientific Creativity Structure Model derived from theoretical accounts of the nature of
scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",80.82827877998352,0.16123008954256626

Defining what constitutes ""scientific"" creativity can pose significant difficulties because there exists no universally accepted standard across disciplines when discussing concepts like innovation, discovery, invention etc., making any comparison difficult. Additionally, even if scientists agree upon their own interpretations of terms used to describe various types of innovative work they often use words differently depending on whether referring to something created through experimentation alone versus someone simply coming up with new ideas based off existing theories/knowledge bases; thus leading to confusion among those unfamiliar with terminology associated with each type of creation. Furthermore, while most people would assume that all successful inventions come from individuals possessing unique abilities - however, studies show that success depends heavily on external resources including access to funding, technology, education & training opportunities, support networks,","that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.
The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.
(5) Creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors of a singu￾lar function originating from mental ability.
Existing tests","measuring instruments. In general creativity research, the proliferation of research
is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

The core elements of creativity according to Torridge include fluency, flexibility, and original thoughtfulness. These qualities represent different dimensions within what has become known as ""the psychological traits"" associated with successful creators.  Fluidity refers to the amount of unique thoughts generated while Flexibility involves changing tactics when faced with challenges. Lastly, originalness indicates rarity among creations made during experimentation. Both approaches share similarities since both focus heavily upon measuring cognitive abilities such as imagination, insight, innovation, etc. However, there exists some difference between them due to their differing methods of measurement. While Torricelli focuses mainly on statistical analysis through his test names like TCCA, Huffman et al. use descriptive words instead but still measure each component separately.","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

Divergent thinking plays a crucial part in fostering innovative solutions within various areas of study such as engineering, mathematics, physics etc. It enables individuals to think beyond conventional methods by exploring alternative perspectives and generating unique combinations of thoughts leading to original breakthroughs. By embracing diverse approaches and recognizing similarities among seemingly unrelated concepts, scientists are able to uncover hidden patterns and connections that were previously unnoticed. Furthermore, divergent thinking encourages experimentation and exploration, allowing researchers to push their intellectual boundaries while maintaining focus on achieving desired outcomes. Ultimately, diversified thinking enhances both analytical skills and imaginative capabilities necessary for successful innovation across different disciplines.  <|endoftext|> The teacher gave John extra help because he was struggling with math class. <|beginostory","divergent thinking is no longer considered to be synonymous with creative ability,

Scientical creativity can be defined as any form of cognitive skill which produces new ideas through experimentation, discovery, invention, design, analysis, interpretation, application etc. Creative scientists use their imagination and intellect to come up with innovative solutions to problems they encounter during their work. They also apply critical thinking abilities when evaluating data collected while conducting various types of investigations. Additionally, successful creation involves combining existing theories/knowledge along with practical experience gained throughout life experiences. Finally, effective communication plays its part too; being able to explain complex concepts clearly helps create better products than simply having them written down without explanation. All four elements together make up the essence of scientific creativity.  <br> <b><i>(Note</i></b>: I used ""","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be

(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and

According to the provided description, there seems to be no consensus among scholars regarding which elements distinguish scientific creativity from other types of creativity. Some argue that its main characteristic lies in being distinctively focused on creating new products through experimentation while others believe that effective solutions can also arise from innovative thinking without necessarily involving any form of creation. Additionally, scientists claim they possess both cognitive abilities necessary for successful innovation along with physical resources like laboratory equipment and materials needed for their work. Furthermore, most agree that environmental conditions play a significant role in fostering artistic expression; however, few recognize the importance of collaboration when discussing scientific creativity. Overall, despite differing opinions, all seem to acknowledge that having access to appropriate tools plays a crucial part in achieving success in scientific creations.

assessment. They are: tests of divergent thinking; attitude and interest inventories;
personality inventories; biographical inventories; rating by teachers, peers, and

schools, we chose to focus on the first of these categories. Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of
Creative Thinking (Torrance 1990). This is a paper-and-pencil test which taps divergent thinking abilities. Items are scored for fluency, flexibility, and original
thinking. Recently, activity- based approaches in measuring creativity have also been used (Kitto et al. 1994). As to scientific creativity of secondary school
students, several tests have been developed. Friedlander (1983) developed a test

Inventory scales. Overall the patterns showed only minor differences. A new scale,
Creative Temperament (CT), was developed using this sample of graduate
students and their professors’ ratings of their creativity. Not surprisingly, this CT
scale was correlated with the creativity ratings of both women (.33) and men
(.25) in this sample.
Another method of creativity assessment is to ask teachers or peers to rate a
person’s creativity. Lau and Li (1996) asked 633 Hong Kong fifth-grade students
and their teachers to evaluate the creativity of the students in their class. Boys
were regarded as more creative by their classmates, but there was no gender
difference in teachers’ ratings. It should be noted that although used routinely in
screening for gifted/talented programs, Howieson (1980) and Wallach (1970)
have warned that teacher ratings of students’ creativity may be poor predictors of
creative performance.

not be used for assessing scientific creativity of junior high school students whose
scientific knowledge is limited. We also question their cross-cultural applicability

school science teachers in China were asked to review these 48 items and select
those which he or she thought would demonstrate scientific creativity in secondary

The next step would involve conducting additional studies involving participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. These studies could include comparing scores across multiple languages, examining relationships among various types of creative tasks performed during testing sessions, evaluating reliability through repeated trials using similar measures, exploring predictors of performance based upon individual characteristics, etc. Additionally, there must be validation against established methods currently employed within educational psychology fields; specifically those designed around cognitive processes associated with learning and problem-solving skills. Finally, predictions regarding how successful the test will be when administered to individuals of varying ages and abilities should be conducted before its implementation into classrooms.  <|endofinput> <br/> <!-- Output --> Table 7 - Acceptance Score Distribution Across Students & Language Groups | Mean Scores (%)","scientific creativity.

Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general","tific creativity of secondary school students, as a domain creativity, should be
unifactor so it is reasonable for us only get one factor in the analysis. The result
suggested that the test has good construct-related validity, measuring one factor, scientific creativity. Another type of validity determined in this study is face validity: do the items
look like they test scientific creativity? To obtain a measure of face validity of the
creativity test, 35 science education researchers and science teachers from England
and China were asked the question, ‘which items in the test can measure scientific
creativity of secondary school students?’ The results are shown in table 5, suggest￾ing a high degree of face validity amongst science education researchers and
science teachers.
Acceptability to students
Finally, for a test to be used successfully in assessing scientific creativity of sec- ondary school students, it should have at least some level of acceptance by the
students. To test this, 60 students tested were asked the question, ‘Which items did you find interesting and which uninteresting in the test?’ Results are shown in
table 6, indicating a satisfactory level of acceptability by the students.

Human: What is the role of convergent thinking in the creative process and how does it interact with divergent thinking according to Arthur Cropley?
Assistant: According to Arthur Cropley, convergent thinking plays a crucial role in the creative process. It is involved in the evaluation of novelty, which is generated through divergent thinking. Convergent thinking uses knowledge to provide ideas, suggest solutions, and establish criteria of effectiveness and novelty. The interaction between divergent and convergent thinking can be understood in terms of thinking styles or phases in the creation of creative products. In practical situations, divergent thinking without convergent thinking can lead to problems such as reckless change. However, a balance must be maintained as both too little and too much convergent thinking can be detrimental to creativity.","The primary purpose of converging thought processes within any given situation is to generate novel answers while maintaining clarity regarding what has been learned so far as well as ensuring validity when evaluating new possibilities. This type of thinking allows us to recognize patterns we have seen before and apply them accordingly rather than relying solely upon our own experiences. By combining these two types of thoughts - divergence and convergence – individuals become able to create something unique yet still grounded in their prior experience. As such, they may find themselves creating original works of art, music, literature etc. However, there could always exist some degree of uncertainty due to lack of familiarity with certain concepts or unfamiliarity with specific tools used during creation.

superordinate ability to acquire, process, and store in￾formation; form abstract, general networks; develop
knowledge matrices; and form systems and the like.
Whether convergent or divergent products result de￾pends on the way in which this thinking power is ap￾plied: to produce more of the same, or to generate nov￾elty. This conceptualization of the interaction regards
differences between convergent and divergent thinking
as qualitative rather than quantitative: Regardless of
level, mental ability can tend to be convergent or diver￾gent. An example of this approach is seen in the work
of Hudson (1968).
The Alternation Approach

phase model, which was first introduced into creativity
research about 80 years ago (Wallas, 1926). In the
phase of preparation, a person becomes thoroughly fa￾miliar with a content area. In the incubation phase, the

Assistant: Divergent thinking is the process of producing multiple or alternative answers from available information. It contributes to creativity by requiring the making of unexpected combinations, recognizing links among remote associates, and transforming information into unexpected forms.","
Divergent thinking refers to any type of mental activity where one generates multiple ideas without necessarily being able to evaluate them all before making decisions. It involves exploring different possibilities instead of relying solely on existing solutions. The goal of this kind of thinking is usually to generate novel perspectives so that people are better equipped to solve complex issues. By considering alternative approaches, individuals become aware of their biases and assumptions; they learn to think critically and creatively while expanding their range of options. Ultimately, diversifying thoughts helps create innovative outcomes since each idea has unique qualities that could potentially help address challenges differently compared to other alternatives. Therefore, divergent thinking plays a crucial part in fostering innovation due to providing fresh insight into various aspects of life.  <|endoft","thinking following on divergent thinking leads to a cor￾rect decision—in the case of convergent thinking we

problems. Lubart (1994) pointed out that problem solving can lead to creativity
because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scien￾tific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important
feature of the creative process. Einstein and Infield (1938) suggested that the
formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, which may
be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. Products provide us with the

   Diverging thought processes lead to greater levels of original ideas as they allow people to explore different possibilities without being limited by preconceived notions. They encourage exploration beyond what has been done before so new solutions may arise. Creativity often arises when someone combines two seemingly unrelated concepts together resulting in something unique. For instance, if you combine metalworking skills with engineering principles then there could potentially come up with innovative designs such as bridges made entirely out of recycled metals. Additionally, diversifying our perspectives allows us to think differently and look towards alternative approaches instead of relying solely on traditional methods. By doing so, individuals become better equipped to solve problems creatively because their minds have expanded due to exposure to various viewpoints.  On the contrary, convergent thoughts","creative production does not derive from divergent
thinking alone but also requires convergent thinking
(e.g., Brophy, 1998; Rickards, 1993). The contribution
of convergent thinking to the generation of creative
products is the subject of this article.
Convergent Versus Divergent Thinking
Convergent thinking is oriented toward deriving the
single best (or correct) answer to a clearly defined
question. It emphasizes speed, accuracy, logic, and the
like and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapply￾ing set techniques, and accumulating information.
Therefore, it is most effective in situations where a
ready-made answer exists and needs simply to be re￾called from stored information or worked out from
what is already known by applying conventional and
logical search, recognition, and decision-making strat￾egies. One of the most important aspects of convergent
thinking is that it leads to a single best answer and,
thus, leaves no room for ambiguity: Answers are either
right or wrong. Convergent thinking is also intimately
linked to knowledge: On the one hand, it involves ma￾nipulation of existing knowledge by means of standard
procedures; and on the other hand, its main result is
production of increased knowledge.","thinking following on divergent thinking leads to a cor￾rect decision—in the case of convergent thinking we

Pseudocreativity refers to creating novel ideas based solely upon self-expression such as painting pictures randomly, playing music freely, etc. QuasisCREATIVITY goes beyond simple imagination and includes generating surprising effects via imaginative expression while maintaining some formality towards existing norms. This type of innovation often leads to unexpected outcomes due to unrestricted exploration rather than conforming to established rules. While these two types share similarities, they have distinct characteristics. Pseudoscience relies heavily on personal experience and subjective interpretation, lacking scientific rigor and empirical evidence. On the contrary, quasiscreavity incorporates critical analysis and logical reasoning within artistic expressions, allowing creators to explore uncharted territories safely. Ultimately, quasiscreation encourages experimentation and pushes boundaries,","on sensitivity to problems, word fluency, ideational
fluency, semantic flexibility, associational fluency, and

production of variability by means of fluency, flexibil￾ity, and originality does not, on its own, guarantee cre￾ativity. Variability may cause surprise in the beholder,
it is true, but this is not necessarily enough because sur￾prise can be produced through mere unregulated
self-expression (e.g., daubing paint on paper, writing
text in any way that pleases the writer, or picking out
notes at random on the piano) or by doing things differ￾ently from the usual regardless of accuracy, meaning,
sense, significance, or interest.

seem to involve production of effective novelty without
convergent thinking are luck or chance and intuition.

Among the more theoretical discussions of the role
of chance in creativity is the evolutionary view of,
among others, Campbell (1960) and Simonton (1988).
In this approach, ideas are thought to evolve through
what Sternberg and Davidson (1999, p. 68) called
“haphazard recombinations” of ideas in a process of
“blind variation” (Campbell, 1960, p. 380). Occa￾sionally, a happy combination occurs: When this is rec￾ognized as involving a creative “configuration”
(Simonton, 1988, p. 2), “selective retention” (Camp￾bell, 1960, p. 380) occurs. However, even if this is an
accurate description of the process of production of ef￾fective novelty, the “mental elements” (Simonton,
1988, p. 6) involved in the haphazard recombinations
are themselves pieces of information (facts, principles,
relations, rules, laws, formulae, etc.)—in other words,",78.92440438270569,0.13978002788897007

The main finding of JCPP 44 - 2 – 2008 by John Black suggests that any behavioural science who argues that one sex is less capable of being creatively inclined faces immense criticism and ridicule if they dare even suggest otherwise. The study also indicates that while overall men may show higher levels of creativity compared to their female counterparts, individual variations exist within each group which need careful consideration before making broad claims based solely upon statistical averages. Furthermore, research into how different domains affect performance shows little difference between sexes but does reveal certain tasks require specific skillsets unique to particular groups.

Gender Differences in Creativity
Kogan’s 1974 review. Yet we find that we share Kogan’s relief that although
there is considerable evidence of differences in patterns and areas of strengths
between the genders, there is still relative equality in creative ability.
There has clearly been a greater openness to investigating gender differences
in recent years, and some authors, such as Piirto (1991a, 1991b, 2004), have
made powerful arguments to explain the observed differences. Yet despite the
many studies that have been done, gender differences in creativity has not be￾come an important focus in either the creativity or psychology of women litera￾tures. A few examples of this neglect:
• A handbook on the psychology of women (Denmark & Paludi, 1993) hailed
as the most “comprehensive” and “systematic” review of literature available
on the psychology of women (Babledelis, 1995, p. 639) made no reference
to either creativity or divergent thinking. Neither did Unger’s (2001) Hand￾book of the Psychology of Women and Gender or Worrell’s (2001) two￾volume Encyclopedia of Women and Gender.
• Neither creativity nor divergent thinking is mentioned in the third and latest","Journal of Creative Behavior
79
For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of

Gender Differences in Creativity
ABSTRACT
Research on gender differences in creativity, including creativity test scores,
creative achievements, and self-reported creativity is reviewed, as are theories
that have been offered to explain such differences and available evidence that
supports or refutes such theories. This is a difficult arena in which to conduct
research, but there is a consistent lack of gender differences both in creativity test
scores and in the creative accomplishments of boys and girls (which if anything
tend to favor girls). As a result, it is difficult to show how innate gender differences
in creativity could possibly explain later differences in creative accomplishment.
At the same time, the large difference in the creative achievement of men and
women in many fields make blanket environmental explanations inadequate, and
the explanations that have been proposed thus far are at best incomplete. A new
theoretical framework (the APT model of creativity) is proposed to allow better
understanding of what is known about gender differences in creativity.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN SCORES ON CREATIVITY TESTS
Divergent thinking tests have dominated creativity testing, and the various Tor￾rance Tests (Torrance, 1966a, 1966b, 1966c, 1970, 1981, 1988, 1990a, 1990b;","78

EVIDENCE OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CREATIVITY
OVERVIEW
This section reviews research that touches on or directly addresses the ques￾tion of gender differences in creativity. We have divided this section based on
age (preschool/elementary, middle school, high school, and adults). When
participants fell into more than one age category, we used the age of the most
participants.
In the first subsection (Gender Differences in Scores on Creativity Tests), dif￾ferences in scores on creativity tests — mostly divergent thinking tests — are
considered. Here is a one-sentence summary of that subsection: While there are
research results pointing in various and often contradictory directions, the
evidence does not clearly support gender differences in creativity based on test
results; however, to the extent that a case for such gender differences can be
made, the available evidence suggests that women and girls tend to score higher
on creativity tests than men and boys.
The second subsection (Gender Differences in Subjective Assessments) goes
into more detail about self-assessments, assessments by others, and personality￾style assessments. The third subsection (Gender Differences in Creative Achieve￾ment) considers differences in creative accomplishment. This subsection does","creativity are most likely the product of differing environments would represent
the best overall synthesis of what we currently know about gender differences
in creativity.

For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of
creativity. However, to review gender differences in the results of creativity testing
means, for better or worse, reviewing mostly studies of gender differences in
divergent thinking test scores.

In order to create effective design concepts, designers need to balance originality with practical considerations such as cost efficiency and functionality. Additionally, economists have found that there are certain factors affecting consumer behavior regarding purchasing decisions - these include price points, quality levels, customer service experiences etc. Therefore, while being able to produce novel creations is important, so too is ensuring those created meet customers' needs efficiently and economically viable.

It was common to conflate creativity and genius in
Bethune’s (1839) era, and, in fact, that same blend can
be seen well into the 1900s.
Bethune (1839) quoted Shakespeare when describing
the two facets of genius:
The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glace from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven—
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name. (p. 59)
This is from A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Act 5,
Scene 1, which was probably written after 1590 but
before 1596) and not surprisingly is only two lines
below what is probably the Shakespearean quotation
most often cited in creativity research, namely, ‘‘The
lunatic, lover, and the poet=Are of imagination all","Weisberg (2003) showed that even an extraordinarily
radical product such as Picasso’s Les demoiselles
d’Avignon derived from what Picasso had experi￾enced up until the time he painted it.
The position of knowledge as the basis of creativity
has been put in more formal terms by Boden (1994a),
using the language of artifical intelligence. What I call
“knowledge,” Boden (1994a) called “cognitive maps”
of a “conceptual space” (p. 8). The more structural fea￾tures of a conceptual space such as, let us say, music
are represented in a person’s mind (i.e., the more the
person knows about music, the more creative the per￾son can be). Boden (1994a) gave the example of Mo￾zart and concluded that Mozart’s creativity arose from
his vast musical knowledge.
Knowledge Defines What Is Creative
As Sternberg and Lubart (1999, p. 3) put it, a cre￾ative product must be adapted to “task constraints.”",74.69278931617737,0.10345308535637976

Human: What are the essential qualities of Genius as defined in Bethune's era?
Assistant: The essential qualities of Genius as defined in Bethune's era are originality of conception and energy of expression.","
In order to define ""genius"" according to Bethune's era, we need to examine his words carefully. He used phrases such as 'origins' and 'creative minds', indicating original ideas being generated by imaginative thoughts. Additionally, he mentioned how these creations were expressed through various mediums like poetry and painting - both requiring artistic skillful execution. Furthermore, there seems to have been no mention of any specific time frame within this period; however, if we consider modern times, then perhaps our definition could include elements inspired by contemporary artists who possess unique perspectives on their craft. Ultimately, I believe that George Washington Carver had something similar in mind while defining him during his lifetime – someone whose innovative approach towards agriculture revolutionized farming practices","the highest style of art. The one adds grace, the other
value. It would be a poor summing up of a life upon
earth, to find that all the powers of an immortal intellect
had been devoted to the amusement of idle hours, or the
excitement of empty mirth, or even the mere gratifi￾cation of taste, without a single effort to make men wiser
and better and happier. If the examination be made, it
will be found, that those works of Genius are the most
appreciated, which are the most pregnant with truth,
which give us the best illustrations of nature, the best
pictures of the human heart, the best maxims of life, in
a word, which are the most useful. (p. 61)
