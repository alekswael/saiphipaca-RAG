A scientific creativity test for secondary school
students
Weiping Hu, Shanxi Teachers’ University, China and Philip Adey, King’s College London, UK
This study describes the development of a test of scientific creativity for use with secondary school
students. A Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of an analysis of
meanings and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took
part in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their analyses and comments, and drawing on
the experience of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring scientific
creativity of secondary school students was developed and validated through analyses of item response data of 160 secondary school students in England. Item analyses were conducted to check on item
discrimination, internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities. As an example of how the test might be
used, data from the pilot use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific creativity of
students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary","presented an investment theory of creativity. The theory comprises six resources
for creativity of which intelligence is one. Although creativity is related to intelli- gence, it is also influenced by other factors, such as motivation, personality, knowl- edge, and environment. The development of creativity is the effect of all these
factors. So intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity (Rossiman and Horn 1971); that is, although intelligence appears to
allow the development of creativity, it does not ensure that creative expression
always will be forthcoming (Schubert 1973). It is clear that all these theories and
researches are consistent with the conclusion of the present pilot study.
Summary and further work
The study reported here is a preliminary attempt to develop and validate a scien￾tific creativity test for secondary school students, with the hope that more empiri- cal work of this nature will be taken up by interested creativity and science
education researchers. A 7-item test was developed based on a Scientific Creativity Structure Model derived from theoretical accounts of the nature of
scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",78.22359323501587,0.9479383992054871

As early as 1960, there were already between 50 and 60 definitions of creativity in the literature. This wide range of definitions has made it virtually impossible to arrive at an integrated and agreed-upon definition. The lack of a clear definition has led to a variety of techniques being used to assess creativity.

Different researchers have focused on different aspects of the creative process, such as the creative product, creative person, creative environment, and creative process. This has resulted in a wide variety of techniques being used to assess creativity. However, when it comes to assessing scientific creativity, it is important to consider the domain-specific knowledge and skills required. General creativity tests are not sufficient for assessing scientific creativity because they do not take into account the specific knowledge and skills needed in the scientific domain.

The challenges in defining scientific creativity and the need for domain-specific knowledge and skills have impacted the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have recognized the importance of specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative thinking. They have emphasized the need for a knowledge base that is well-organized and easily retrievable in problem-solving or creative thinking situations. This has led to the development of more domain-specific assessments of creativity.

In summary, the challenges in defining scientific creativity and the recognition of the importance of domain-specific knowledge and skills have influenced the development of techniques to assess creativity. Researchers have moved towards developing assessments that take into account the specific requirements of the scientific domain, rather than relying on general creativity tests.","
Defining what constitutes ""scientific"" creativity can pose significant difficulties because there exists no universally accepted standard across disciplines when discussing concepts like innovation, discovery, invention etc., making any comparison difficult. Additionally, even if scientists agree upon their own interpretations of terms used to describe innovative work they often disagree regarding whether those words accurately reflect actual behavior; therefore, determining exactly where each field begins and ends could lead to confusion among readers trying to make sense of complex terminology. Furthermore, while most people would assume that all successful inventions come from brilliant minds working alone, recent studies show that collaboration plays just as important - sometimes much more than – solo efforts. Therefore, attempting to measure something abstract yet subjective makes little practical use without first establishing criteria against which success can be","that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.
The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.
(5) Creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors of a singu￾lar function originating from mental ability.
Existing tests","measuring instruments. In general creativity research, the proliferation of research
is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, while flexibility is the ability to change approaches when the current one is no longer efficient. Originality is interpreted statistically, meaning that answers that are rare and occur infrequently in a given population are considered to be original. Hudson's (1966) approach aligns with Torrance's view as he also considered rare answers to be more valuable than common ones. In his study, Hudson asked students to think of multiple uses for a brick and gave higher scores to answers that were rare and occurred infrequently. Therefore, both Torrance and Hudson emphasize the importance of fluency, flexibility, and originality in assessing creativity.","
The core elements of creativity according to Torridge include fluency, flexibility, and originality. These refer to the amount of unique thoughts generated, their adaptability when faced with new challenges, and whether such thought processes occur frequently within specific populations. Additionally, there was also emphasis placed upon statistical significance rather than anecdotal evidence due to its rarity among individuals. This aligned well with Hudson's 2006 study where his participants scored significantly lower if asked ""How often do you come up with innovative solutions?"" compared to other groups who answered 'never' or 'rarely'. He believed that people tend to produce fewer novel concepts but still possess high levels of ingenuity.  Hudson suggested using statistics instead of anecdotes because stories may lack objectivity while numbers offer","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

Human: What is the role of divergent thinking in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields?
Assistant: The text does not provide specific information on the role of divergent thinking in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields.","Divergent thinking is considered an important component of creative potential in scientific fields. It is no longer synonymous with creative ability, but it still plays a significant role. Divergent thinking allows individuals to generate a wide range of ideas, solutions, and possibilities when faced with new problems. It is through divergent thinking that creative solutions can be found. Sensitivity to problems and the ability to recognize and formulate them is also considered a component of scientific creativity. Divergent thinking helps in expanding the variability and generating new ideas, which can lead to effective novelty and change. However, it is important to note that divergent thinking alone is not sufficient. Convergent thinking, which involves evaluating and selecting the most appropriate ideas or solutions, is also necessary for effective problem-solving and creativity. Both divergent and convergent thinking processes are important in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in scientific fields.","
Divergent thinking plays a crucial part in fostering innovative solutions within various areas of study including those found in sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics etc. It enables scientists to think beyond conventional methods by exploring alternative perspectives and generating unique combinations of thoughts leading them towards breakthrough discoveries. By embracing diverse approaches and recognizing similarities among seemingly unrelated concepts, researchers are able to uncover hidden patterns and connections previously unseen. Furthermore, divergent thinking encourages individuals to challenge existing beliefs and explore uncharted territories, allowing their minds to expand and adapt to changing circumstances. Ultimately, diversified thinking enhances both analytical skills and imaginative capabilities necessary for successful innovation across different disciplines.  <|endoftext|> The teacher gave John extra help because he was struggling while","divergent thinking is no longer considered to be synonymous with creative ability,

because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scien￾tific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important

expert) can provide a substantial knowledge base that
can be manipulated to yield effective novelty (i.e., it
can benefit divergent thinking). However, the preexist￾ing knowledge of an expert can also act as a corset that
blocks novel ideas so that thinking leads only to pro￾duction of tried and trusted “correct” answers.

Human: What is the relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity according to various scholars?
Assistant: According to various scholars, problem-solving can lead to creativity because the existence of a problem opens up the possibility of a creative solution. Sensitivity to problems is considered a component of scientific creativity and an important feature of the creative process. The formulation of a problem is often seen as more important than its solution, as the solution may simply be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.","According to various scholars, there is a relationship between problem-solving, sensitivity to problems, and creativity. Flavell (1976) discusses the metacognitive aspects of problem-solving, which involves being aware of one's own thinking processes and strategies. This metacognitive awareness can contribute to creative problem-solving. 

In their study, Okuda, Runco, and Berger (1991) found that creativity is related to the finding and solving of real-life problems. They suggest that individuals who are more creative are better able to identify and address problems in their environment. 

Mumford et al. (1991) conducted a process analysis of creative capacities and found that problem-solving is a key component of creativity. They argue that individuals who are more skilled at problem-solving are more likely to exhibit creative thinking and generate innovative solutions. 

Overall, these scholars suggest that problem-solving and sensitivity to problems are important factors in fostering creativity.","According to Albert Solway’s theory on geniuseminences he believes there are three main components which make up someone who can solve complex problems creatively - domain knowledge, metacognition skills, and emotional resilience. According to John Dewey his model consists of four elements – curiosity, imagination, experimentation, and reflection; while Jean Piaget believed it was composed of five key stages including sensorimotor stage, preoperative stage, concrete operational stage, formal operational stage, and postformal/adult cognitive stage. Additionally, Carol Gilligan proposed her own framework consisting of two distinct dimensions of gender identity such as caregiving versus competition.

Scientical creativity can be defined as any form of cognitive skill which produces new ideas through experimentation, discovery, invention, design, analysis, interpretation, application, synthesis etc. Creative scientists use their imagination, curiosity, intuition, reasoning abilities, critical thinking, communication skills, patience & perseverance while working towards solving problems/exploring unknown territories. They also possess strong observational skills along with effective decision making capabilities. Their work involves designing innovative solutions based upon existing theories / concepts; they develop methods to test those designs; analyze data collected during testing processes; interpret findings obtained after analyzing them; apply learned principles to solve real world issues - all requiring both technical expertise and artistic flair.

The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity.

Secondly, scientific creativity is considered a kind of ability, and its structure does not include non-intellectual factors.

Furthermore, they assert that successful experimentation necessitates specialized skill sets beyond those typically found elsewhere.

A review of methods used to assess creative thinking is provided by Hocever and
Bachelor (1989) who proposed a taxonomy that has eight categories of creativity
assessment. They are: tests of divergent thinking; attitude and interest inventories;
personality inventories; biographical inventories; rating by teachers, peers, and
supervisors; judgements of products; eminence; and self-reported creative activ￾ities and achievements. For the purpose of a test to be administered in secondary
schools, we chose to focus on the first of these categories. Perhaps the best known test of general creativity is the Torrance Test of
Creative Thinking (Torrance 1990). This is a paper-and-pencil test which taps divergent thinking abilities. Items are scored for fluency, flexibility, and original
thinking. Recently, activity- based approaches in measuring creativity have also been used (Kitto et al. 1994). As to scientific creativity of secondary school
students, several tests have been developed. Friedlander (1983) developed a test
in which 143 high school students responded to a plant or animal stimulus through","Heinelt, G. (1974). Kreative Lehrer=kreative Schu¨ler [Creative

Inventory scales. Overall the patterns showed only minor differences. A new scale,
Creative Temperament (CT), was developed using this sample of graduate
students and their professors’ ratings of their creativity. Not surprisingly, this CT
scale was correlated with the creativity ratings of both women (.33) and men
(.25) in this sample.
Another method of creativity assessment is to ask teachers or peers to rate a
person’s creativity. Lau and Li (1996) asked 633 Hong Kong fifth-grade students
and their teachers to evaluate the creativity of the students in their class. Boys
were regarded as more creative by their classmates, but there was no gender
difference in teachers’ ratings. It should be noted that although used routinely in
screening for gifted/talented programs, Howieson (1980) and Wallach (1970)
have warned that teacher ratings of students’ creativity may be poor predictors of
creative performance.

Elaboration means having enough detail to support each idea generated by yourself during this test. Each category has its own score scale ranging from zero to 100.

thinking testing. Perhaps most popular are the Torrance Tests for Creative Think￾ing (TTCT; Torrance, 1966c, 1970, 1974, 1990a, 1990b). According to one view
of creativity research (Torrance & Presbury, 1984), three-quarters of all published
studies used one of the Torrance Tests, and one meta-analytic evaluation of the
effects of various creativity training programs (Rose & Lin, 1984) judged the Tor￾rance Tests to be so pervasive that it included only studies which had employed
these tests. Add to these studies those that have used one of the Wallach and
Kogan (1965) divergent thinking tests and it is easy to see that divergent thinking
tests have been ubiquitous as measures of creativity.

imagination, analysis capabilities, and transformation abilities. Although these tests are useful in measuring scientific creativity of secondary
school students, they are somewhat dependent on science knowledge, so they can
not be used for assessing scientific creativity of junior high school students whose
scientific knowledge is limited. We also question their cross-cultural applicability
since they were developed within specific cultural groups. We believe there
remains a need to develop a test which can be used for assessing the scientific
creativity of all secondary school students at different ages and in different
cultures.

The three dimensional model of scientific creativity described above offers 24 cells
for each of which items may in principle be designed. In order to explore the face validity of these cells, a questionnaire was developed with two items for each of the 24 cells – that is 48 items in total. 50 science education researchers and secondary
school science teachers in China were asked to review these 48 items and select
those which he or she thought would demonstrate scientific creativity in secondary
school students. The result suggested that some aspects were considered more
important and viable than others and on this basis an initial test of nine items was drafted. Each item encompassed more than one cell of the model. In drafting these nine items, we referred also to existing general creativity","Full Terms & Conditions of access and use can be found at

Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general","tific creativity of secondary school students, as a domain creativity, should be
unifactor so it is reasonable for us only get one factor in the analysis. The result
suggested that the test has good construct-related validity, measuring one factor, scientific creativity. Another type of validity determined in this study is face validity: do the items
look like they test scientific creativity? To obtain a measure of face validity of the
creativity test, 35 science education researchers and science teachers from England
and China were asked the question, ‘which items in the test can measure scientific
creativity of secondary school students?’ The results are shown in table 5, suggest￾ing a high degree of face validity amongst science education researchers and
science teachers.
Acceptability to students
Finally, for a test to be used successfully in assessing scientific creativity of sec- ondary school students, it should have at least some level of acceptance by the
students. To test this, 60 students tested were asked the question, ‘Which items did you find interesting and which uninteresting in the test?’ Results are shown in
table 6, indicating a satisfactory level of acceptability by the students.

Human: What is the role of convergent thinking in the creative process and how does it interact with divergent thinking according to Arthur Cropley?
Assistant: According to Arthur Cropley, convergent thinking plays a crucial role in the creative process. It is involved in the evaluation of novelty, which is generated through divergent thinking. Convergent thinking uses knowledge to provide ideas, suggest solutions, and establish criteria of effectiveness and novelty. The interaction between divergent and convergent thinking can be understood in terms of thinking styles or phases in the creation of creative products. In practical situations, divergent thinking without convergent thinking can lead to problems such as reckless change. However, a balance must be maintained as both too little and too much convergent thinking can be detrimental to creativity.","According to Arthur Cropley, convergent thinking plays a crucial role in the creative process. It is not enough to rely solely on divergent thinking, as creative production requires both convergent and divergent thinking. Convergent thinking is focused on finding the single best answer to a well-defined question. It emphasizes speed, accuracy, logic, and the application of known techniques and accumulated information. It is most effective in situations where there is a ready-made answer that can be recalled or worked out using conventional search and decision-making strategies. 

Convergent thinking is closely linked to knowledge. On one hand, it involves manipulating existing knowledge using standard procedures. On the other hand, it leads to the production of increased knowledge. Knowledge serves as a source of ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria for evaluating effectiveness and novelty. 

In the creative process, divergent thinking generates novelty, while convergent thinking evaluates that novelty. They work together in terms of thinking styles or phases in the generation of creative products. However, it is important to strike a balance between the two types of thinking. Overreliance on divergent thinking without convergent thinking can lead to reckless change and problems. Similarly, too much emphasis on convergent thinking can also hinder creativity. Therefore, both convergent and divergent thinking are necessary for a balanced and effective creative process.","The Role of Converge­nt Thinkings in Creative Processes According To Arthur Cropley  <br> <b><u>(¶2):</u></b>: ""As we have seen before, there has been considerable debate over what makes up “true"" creativity – some argue that true creativity comes solely from imaginative exploration while others believe that successful creation relies heavily upon logical reasoning."" This essay argues that both types of thought processes play crucial roles within any given situation - however they do so differently depending on whether you're dealing with something abstract like artistry or concrete things such as engineering design"". As stated above, these two different ways of approaching problem solving lead us into another discussion regarding their interaction between each other when applied to real world","Full Terms & Conditions of access and use can be found at

   According to debates within the field during the period after Sputnikskia, there were two distinct approaches towards generating new creations - ""convergence"" and ""divergence"". While both had their own merits, convergence focused primarily on finding ready answers while divergence encouraged exploration and experimentation. However, as time progressed, researchers began realizing that combining these different modes could lead to even greater levels of innovation. Thus, they started referring to them as 'alternative' models instead of just 'convolution'. These alternative models emphasized how individuals used their cognitive abilities differently depending upon whether they wanted to find quick solutions using pre-existing data or explore uncharted territories armed with nothing but imagination.

research about 80 years ago (Wallas, 1926). In the
phase of preparation, a person becomes thoroughly fa￾miliar with a content area. In the incubation phase, the

Convergent Versus Divergent Thinking
Convergent thinking is oriented toward deriving the
single best (or correct) answer to a clearly defined
question. It emphasizes speed, accuracy, logic, and the
like and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapply￾ing set techniques, and accumulating information.
Therefore, it is most effective in situations where a
ready-made answer exists and needs simply to be re￾called from stored information or worked out from
what is already known by applying conventional and
logical search, recognition, and decision-making strat￾egies. One of the most important aspects of convergent
thinking is that it leads to a single best answer and,
thus, leaves no room for ambiguity: Answers are either
right or wrong. Convergent thinking is also intimately
linked to knowledge: On the one hand, it involves ma￾nipulation of existing knowledge by means of standard
procedures; and on the other hand, its main result is
production of increased knowledge.","of divergent and convergent thinking to this process.

Human: What is divergent thinking and how does it contribute to creativity?
Assistant: Divergent thinking is the process of producing multiple or alternative answers from available information. It contributes to creativity by requiring the making of unexpected combinations, recognizing links among remote associates, and transforming information into unexpected forms.","Divergent thinking refers to the ability to generate multiple ideas, solutions, or possibilities in response to a given problem or stimulus. It involves thinking outside the box, exploring different perspectives, and breaking away from conventional or linear thinking patterns. Divergent thinking is considered a crucial component of creativity because it allows for the generation of novel and unique ideas. It helps individuals to explore new possibilities, make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, and think creatively. However, it is important to note that while divergent thinking is important for generating creative ideas, it is not sufficient on its own. Convergent thinking, which involves evaluating and selecting the most appropriate ideas or solutions, is also necessary to ensure the effectiveness and practicality of the generated novelty.","
Divergent thinking refers to any type of mental activity where one generates multiple ideas without necessarily being able to evaluate them all before making decisions. It involves exploring different possibilities instead of relying solely on existing solutions. The goal of this kind of thinking is usually to generate novel perspectives so that people are better equipped to solve complex issues. By generating many alternative options, individuals become aware of their strengths and weaknesses while gaining insight into other ways they could approach similar situations. As such, diversions help foster innovative approaches towards achieving goals since each idea has unique qualities that make it suitable for certain tasks over others. Additionally, these alternatives allow creators to think beyond conventional methods and come up with original concepts that have never been seen before. Ultimately, divergences","thinking following on divergent thinking leads to a cor￾rect decision—in the case of convergent thinking we

it is nevertheless an important component of creative potential (Runco 1991). When we consider scientific products, we can distinguish between technical
products, advances in science knowledge, understanding of scientific phenomena, and scientific problem solving. Cattell (1971) argued that problem solving does not mean solving routine problems using a recipe but finding the answers to new
problems. Lubart (1994) pointed out that problem solving can lead to creativity
because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scien￾tific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important
feature of the creative process. Einstein and Infield (1938) suggested that the
formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, which may
be a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. Products provide us with the
second dimension of our model. Einstein argued that language, as it is written or spoken, did not seem to play a
significant role in his mechanism of thought. He referred rather to psychical signs and more or less clear images which seemed to be voluntarily reproduced and","and suggests what the results might be if divergent

   Diverging thought processes lead to greater levels of original ideas as they allow us to explore different perspectives and possibilities beyond what has been previously established. They encourage exploration and experimentation leading to new solutions and innovative approaches. Creativity arises when these diverse thoughts come together forming unique connections and associations. Conversely, convergent thinking tends towards generating only similar concepts due to focusing solely on finding answers within pre-existing frameworks instead of exploring alternative paths. While both types have their own merits, diversifying our thought patterns allows for broader problem solving capabilities while maintaining focus on achieving specific goals.  <|endoftext|> <br/>

The four types of ""happy"" chances mentioned by Austin relate to different aspects of creation; they include blind happenstance, serene dipitiy, luck of diligence/self-indication, and luck of discovery. Blind happenstane refers to unplanned discoveries made while working diligently towards one goal. Serene Dipitation involves stumbling upon new solutions during seemingly random exploration. Luck of Diligence includes having special qualities like attention to detail which lead to successful outcomes. Lastly, luck of Discovery means finding innovative answers after exploring various paths until success is achieved. All these combinations can contribute positively to creating unique and valuable creations.  <|endoftext|>Once you understand how fractions represent parts of whole numbers, solving fraction problems","Mach, Etienne Souriau, or Alexander Bain have even

puzzling out, testing and checking, etc.). Of course, it
is possible to imagine lucky hits or flukes, wild specu￾lations, or dreams that turn out to be novel and effec￾tive. However, the key question is whether creativity
can, in the normal course of events, result from diver￾gent thinking alone. Two well-known mechanisms that
seem to involve production of effective novelty without
convergent thinking are luck or chance and intuition.
Luck and Chance
There are many examples of apparently lucky com￾binations of events that led to acknowledged creative
solutions (see Rosenman, 1988): For instance, Pasteur,
Fleming, Roentgen, Becquerel, Edison, Galvani, and
Nobel all described chance events that led them to
breakthroughs. Some famous thinkers such as Ernst
Mach, Etienne Souriau, or Alexander Bain have even
concluded that luck is the main factor in creativity.
Austin (1978) identified four kinds of happy chance:","luck at all because at least the luck of the diligent and
also self-induced luck clearly contain elements of con￾vergent thinking (hard work, knowledge, etc).
Among the more theoretical discussions of the role
of chance in creativity is the evolutionary view of,
among others, Campbell (1960) and Simonton (1988).
In this approach, ideas are thought to evolve through
what Sternberg and Davidson (1999, p. 68) called
“haphazard recombinations” of ideas in a process of
“blind variation” (Campbell, 1960, p. 380). Occa￾sionally, a happy combination occurs: When this is rec￾ognized as involving a creative “configuration”
(Simonton, 1988, p. 2), “selective retention” (Camp￾bell, 1960, p. 380) occurs. However, even if this is an
accurate description of the process of production of ef￾fective novelty, the “mental elements” (Simonton,
1988, p. 6) involved in the haphazard recombinations
are themselves pieces of information (facts, principles,
relations, rules, laws, formulae, etc.)—in other words,",72.966796875,0.929884417736657

applicability. There are many new studies of gender differences, some using very

Gender Differences in Creativity
Kogan’s 1974 review. Yet we find that we share Kogan’s relief that although
there is considerable evidence of differences in patterns and areas of strengths
between the genders, there is still relative equality in creative ability.
There has clearly been a greater openness to investigating gender differences
in recent years, and some authors, such as Piirto (1991a, 1991b, 2004), have
made powerful arguments to explain the observed differences. Yet despite the
many studies that have been done, gender differences in creativity has not be￾come an important focus in either the creativity or psychology of women litera￾tures. A few examples of this neglect:
• A handbook on the psychology of women (Denmark & Paludi, 1993) hailed
as the most “comprehensive” and “systematic” review of literature available
on the psychology of women (Babledelis, 1995, p. 639) made no reference
to either creativity or divergent thinking. Neither did Unger’s (2001) Hand￾book of the Psychology of Women and Gender or Worrell’s (2001) two￾volume Encyclopedia of Women and Gender.
• Neither creativity nor divergent thinking is mentioned in the third and latest","Journal of Creative Behavior
79
For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of
creativity. However, to review gender differences in the results of creativity testing
means, for better or worse, reviewing mostly studies of gender differences in
divergent thinking test scores.

Gender Differences in Creativity
ABSTRACT
Research on gender differences in creativity, including creativity test scores,
creative achievements, and self-reported creativity is reviewed, as are theories
that have been offered to explain such differences and available evidence that
supports or refutes such theories. This is a difficult arena in which to conduct
research, but there is a consistent lack of gender differences both in creativity test
scores and in the creative accomplishments of boys and girls (which if anything
tend to favor girls). As a result, it is difficult to show how innate gender differences
in creativity could possibly explain later differences in creative accomplishment.
At the same time, the large difference in the creative achievement of men and
women in many fields make blanket environmental explanations inadequate, and
the explanations that have been proposed thus far are at best incomplete. A new
theoretical framework (the APT model of creativity) is proposed to allow better
understanding of what is known about gender differences in creativity.

EVIDENCE OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CREATIVITY
OVERVIEW
This section reviews research that touches on or directly addresses the ques￾tion of gender differences in creativity. We have divided this section based on
age (preschool/elementary, middle school, high school, and adults). When
participants fell into more than one age category, we used the age of the most
participants.
In the first subsection (Gender Differences in Scores on Creativity Tests), dif￾ferences in scores on creativity tests — mostly divergent thinking tests — are
considered. Here is a one-sentence summary of that subsection: While there are
research results pointing in various and often contradictory directions, the
evidence does not clearly support gender differences in creativity based on test
results; however, to the extent that a case for such gender differences can be
made, the available evidence suggests that women and girls tend to score higher
on creativity tests than men and boys.
The second subsection (Gender Differences in Subjective Assessments) goes
into more detail about self-assessments, assessments by others, and personality￾style assessments. The third subsection (Gender Differences in Creative Achieve￾ment) considers differences in creative accomplishment. This subsection does","creativity are most likely the product of differing environments would represent
the best overall synthesis of what we currently know about gender differences
in creativity.

thinking testing. Perhaps most popular are the Torrance Tests for Creative Think￾ing (TTCT; Torrance, 1966c, 1970, 1974, 1990a, 1990b). According to one view
of creativity research (Torrance & Presbury, 1984), three-quarters of all published
studies used one of the Torrance Tests, and one meta-analytic evaluation of the
effects of various creativity training programs (Rose & Lin, 1984) judged the Tor￾rance Tests to be so pervasive that it included only studies which had employed
these tests. Add to these studies those that have used one of the Wallach and
Kogan (1965) divergent thinking tests and it is easy to see that divergent thinking
tests have been ubiquitous as measures of creativity.

For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of
creativity. However, to review gender differences in the results of creativity testing
means, for better or worse, reviewing mostly studies of gender differences in
divergent thinking test scores.
No simple conclusions can be drawn from the empirical evidence on gender",73.78129386901855,0.9324127755685344

Human: What is the relationship between originality, value, and the market according to economic research on creativity?
Assistant: According to economic research on creativity, the relationship between originality, value, and the market is that original and valuable products and ideas depend on the current market. More specifically, their value is determined by the costs and benefits of contrarianism, or originality.","According to economic research on creativity, the relationship between originality, value, and the market is that original and valuable products and ideas depend on the current market conditions, as well as the costs and benefits of contrarianism (i.e., originality). This means that the value of creative work is influenced by the market and its dynamics.","According to Economic research on creativity, originality plays a crucial part in creating successful product designs by providing consumers with innovative solutions they can use effectively within their budget constraints. In order to create effective design concepts, designers need to balance originality with practical considerations such as cost efficiency and functionality. Additionally, economists have found that there are certain factors affecting consumer behavior regarding purchasing decisions - these include price points, quality levels, customer service experiences etc. Therefore, while being able to produce novel creations is important, so too is ensuring those creations meet customers' needs through appropriate pricing strategies and marketing efforts. Ultimately, success depends upon finding equilibrium where both innovation and profitability exist harmoniously.  <|endoftext|>Once you understand why someone did something, then","appeared nearly 25 years ago, referred to utility when

It was common to conflate creativity and genius in
Bethune’s (1839) era, and, in fact, that same blend can
be seen well into the 1900s.
Bethune (1839) quoted Shakespeare when describing
the two facets of genius:
The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glace from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven—
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name. (p. 59)
This is from A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Act 5,
Scene 1, which was probably written after 1590 but
before 1596) and not surprisingly is only two lines
below what is probably the Shakespearean quotation
most often cited in creativity research, namely, ‘‘The
lunatic, lover, and the poet=Are of imagination all","Weisberg (2003) showed that even an extraordinarily
radical product such as Picasso’s Les demoiselles
d’Avignon derived from what Picasso had experi￾enced up until the time he painted it.
The position of knowledge as the basis of creativity
has been put in more formal terms by Boden (1994a),
using the language of artifical intelligence. What I call
“knowledge,” Boden (1994a) called “cognitive maps”
of a “conceptual space” (p. 8). The more structural fea￾tures of a conceptual space such as, let us say, music
are represented in a person’s mind (i.e., the more the
person knows about music, the more creative the per￾son can be). Boden (1994a) gave the example of Mo￾zart and concluded that Mozart’s creativity arose from
his vast musical knowledge.

In order to define ""genius"" according to Bethune's era, we need to examine his words carefully. He used phrases such as 'origins' and 'creative minds', indicating original ideas being generated by imaginative thoughts. Additionally, he mentioned how these creations were expressed through various mediums like poetry and painting - both requiring artistic skillful execution. Furthermore, there seems to have been no mention of any scientific discoveries during this period; instead, they seemed focused on literature and music.
