Weiping Hu, Shanxi Teachers’ University, China and Philip Adey, King’s College London, UK
This study describes the development of a test of scientific creativity for use with secondary school
students. A Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of an analysis of
meanings and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took
part in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their analyses and comments, and drawing on
the experience of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring scientific
creativity of secondary school students was developed and validated through analyses of item response data of 160 secondary school students in England. Item analyses were conducted to check on item
discrimination, internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities. As an example of how the test might be
used, data from the pilot use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific creativity of
students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary","presented an investment theory of creativity. The theory comprises six resources
for creativity of which intelligence is one. Although creativity is related to intelli- gence, it is also influenced by other factors, such as motivation, personality, knowl- edge, and environment. The development of creativity is the effect of all these
factors. So intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity (Rossiman and Horn 1971); that is, although intelligence appears to
allow the development of creativity, it does not ensure that creative expression
always will be forthcoming (Schubert 1973). It is clear that all these theories and
researches are consistent with the conclusion of the present pilot study.
Summary and further work
The study reported here is a preliminary attempt to develop and validate a scien￾tific creativity test for secondary school students, with the hope that more empiri- cal work of this nature will be taken up by interested creativity and science
education researchers. A 7-item test was developed based on a Scientific Creativity Structure Model derived from theoretical accounts of the nature of
scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",80.88438320159912

    Scientific creativity refers to the cognitive processes involved in generating new ideas, concepts, theories, and solutions through experimentation and inquiry. It encompasses various domains including natural sciences, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and life sciences. However, there exists significant debate regarding its definition and measurement. Some argue that scientific creativity can be assessed based on standardized tests, while others believe that it is best understood through qualitative methods involving interviews and observations. Despite ongoing efforts to develop tools for evaluating scientific creativity, the lack of consensus among experts continues to hinder progress in this field. Additionally, the complexity of scientific creativity makes it challenging to isolate and quantify its components accurately. Researchers often rely on multiple indicators, such as innovative thinking patterns, problem-solving abilities,","that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.
The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.
(5) Creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors of a singu￾lar function originating from mental ability.
Existing tests","measuring instruments. In general creativity research, the proliferation of research
is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

Assistant: Torrance in 1990 considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as the central features of creativity. Fluency refers to the number of original ideas produced, flexibility is the ability to change approach when the established one no longer works efficiently, and originality is interpreted statistically as an answer which is rare or occurs only occasionally in a given population.

    The central features of creativity according to Torrance in 1990 include fluency, flexibility, and originality. Fluency refers to the number of unique ideas generated within a specific time frame. Flexibility involves the ability to adapt and change strategies when faced with challenges or constraints. Originality pertains to producing ideas that are rare, occurring rarely in a particular group or setting. These dimensions collectively define what constitutes creativity.

    Hudson's 1966 approach aligned closely with Torrance's findings regarding creativity. Similar to Torrance, Hudson recognized the importance of fluency, flexibility, and originality in assessing individuals' creative abilities. He believed that creativity was influenced by both innate traits and environmental factors such as education and","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

    Divergent thinking plays a crucial role in enhancing creative potential and problem-solving abilities in various scientific fields. It allows individuals to think beyond conventional solutions by exploring multiple perspectives, generating innovative ideas, and identifying unique connections. By embracing divergent thinking, scientists are able to break free from rigid patterns of thinking and approach complex problems with freshness and curiosity. This enables them to develop groundbreaking theories, discover new applications, and contribute to advancements in their respective disciplines. Moreover, divergent thinking fosters adaptability and resilience, enabling scientists to navigate uncertainties and overcome obstacles during the research process.

    Scientific creativity can be defined as the ability to produce new ideas through scientific experimentation, problem solving, and activity. Unlike other forms of creativity which focus on artistic expression, scientific creativity involves applying scientific methods and principles to generate novel solutions and discoveries. While there is no universally accepted definition of scientific creativity, existing theories suggest that it encompasses various components including innovative thinking, experimental design, data analysis, and effective communication of findings. Additionally, scientists themselves play a crucial role in fostering scientific creativity by encouraging curiosity, collaboration, and critical thinking. By combining their expertise with the tools and resources available, scientists contribute to the advancement of knowledge and innovation across multiple disciplines. Therefore, scientific creativity is a multifaceted phenomenon that goes beyond traditional notions of art","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be

In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.

define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity.

system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","predates online literature searches. Although the science
of creativity is, in some ways, unique and unlike other
scientific endeavors (see Runco, in press, for details), the

and is implicitly collaborative. Research builds on pre￾vious research. Originality is a core value in creativity stu￾dies, but this does not justify ignoring relevant research
that was done previously. Good research is integrated

its originality and utility. Corrections in the CRJ ensure
that due credit is given to earlier research.

1940s, and 1930s. Domain differences were examined in

    Scientific creativity can be distinguished from other forms of creativity because it involves both originality and effectiveness. Unlike other types of creativity where novelty plays a significant role, scientific creativity focuses on creating new ideas and solutions through rigorous experimentation and analysis. While there may be variations in the specific requirements and methods used in each form of creativity, the underlying principles remain consistent across disciplines. By combining elements of innovation, critical thinking, and practical application, scientists demonstrate their capacity for creative problem solving and contribute to advancements in various fields. Additionally, scientific creativity is influenced by external factors such as access to resources, collaboration opportunities, and societal support, which shape its development and impact.

Inventory scales. Overall the patterns showed only minor differences. A new scale,
Creative Temperament (CT), was developed using this sample of graduate
students and their professors’ ratings of their creativity. Not surprisingly, this CT
scale was correlated with the creativity ratings of both women (.33) and men
(.25) in this sample.
Another method of creativity assessment is to ask teachers or peers to rate a
person’s creativity. Lau and Li (1996) asked 633 Hong Kong fifth-grade students
and their teachers to evaluate the creativity of the students in their class. Boys
were regarded as more creative by their classmates, but there was no gender
difference in teachers’ ratings. It should be noted that although used routinely in
screening for gifted/talented programs, Howieson (1980) and Wallach (1970)
have warned that teacher ratings of students’ creativity may be poor predictors of
creative performance.

    The scientific creativity test developed here was validated using two methods. First, the test was administered to a group of science education researchers and science teachers from both England and China. Second, the same test was administered to a group of secondary school students from each country. Both groups completed the test under identical conditions, including instructions provided before taking the test. After completion, all participants answered a series of open-ended questions designed to assess their perceptions of the test and its relevance to their own lives. These qualitative data were then analyzed to determine whether there were any differences in the ways that the test was perceived across countries. Overall, the results showed that the test had acceptable levels of face validity among both groups of participants. Additionally, the test was","scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability
level. The result of these investigations suggest that this test should be useful in
assessing scientific creativity of secondary school students. However, more work needs been done to further validate the test. Test-retest
reliability should be evaluated. Relationships between this test and other scientific
creativity tests as well as other general creativity tests might be studied. More
importantly, predictive validity should be determined. In developing this test, we started with a questionnaire given to Chinese as well as English science educa￾tion researchers and science teachers, but only English students took part in this
study. So larger samples from different cultures should be investigated in future
research.
Although this study concluded that with the increase of age, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity, we cannot generalize these
conclusions beyond the present limited sample. Nevertheless we believe that the","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general","tific creativity of secondary school students, as a domain creativity, should be
unifactor so it is reasonable for us only get one factor in the analysis. The result
suggested that the test has good construct-related validity, measuring one factor, scientific creativity. Another type of validity determined in this study is face validity: do the items
look like they test scientific creativity? To obtain a measure of face validity of the
creativity test, 35 science education researchers and science teachers from England
and China were asked the question, ‘which items in the test can measure scientific
creativity of secondary school students?’ The results are shown in table 5, suggest￾ing a high degree of face validity amongst science education researchers and
science teachers.
Acceptability to students
Finally, for a test to be used successfully in assessing scientific creativity of sec- ondary school students, it should have at least some level of acceptance by the
students. To test this, 60 students tested were asked the question, ‘Which items did you find interesting and which uninteresting in the test?’ Results are shown in
table 6, indicating a satisfactory level of acceptability by the students.

    The role of convergent thinking in the creative process is twofold. Firstly, it helps generate novel ideas by providing a framework within which new concepts can be explored. This is achieved through the application of established procedures, such as brainstorming sessions or structured problem-solving approaches. Secondly, convergent thinking allows us to evaluate these novel ideas based on their feasibility, relevance, and potential impact. By critically analyzing the generated ideas, we can determine whether they align with our goals and objectives, and make informed decisions regarding their implementation. While convergent thinking may seem restrictive compared to divergent thinking, it actually serves as a necessary foundation upon which innovative ideas can flourish.

    Convergent thinking refers to the process of generating a single correct answer to a well-defined question using logical reasoning and accumulated knowledge. It involves focusing on finding the ""best"" or ""correct"" answer while disregarding any potential ambiguities or uncertainties. By relying on established procedures and rules, convergent thinkers aim to minimize errors and increase efficiency. While convergent thinking may lead to quick solutions, it often limits the exploration of alternative perspectives and innovative ideas. Additionally, the reliance on pre-existing knowledge restricts the generation of new concepts and possibilities. Overall, convergent thinking has both positive and negative impacts depending on how it is applied.

can be manipulated to yield effective novelty (i.e., it

blocks novel ideas so that thinking leads only to pro￾duction of tried and trusted “correct” answers.

    Divergent thinking refers to the process of generating multiple ideas, solutions, or possibilities within a given framework or constraint. It involves exploring various paths, perspectives, and alternatives without being bound by traditional norms or established rules. By allowing individuals to think beyond conventional boundaries, divergent thinking encourages innovation, originality, and the development of novel concepts. While divergent thinking alone cannot guarantee successful outcomes, it plays a crucial role in fostering creativity by providing a platform for exploration, experimentation, and the generation of diverse ideas. Through this approach, individuals are able to break free from rigid constraints and discover unique solutions that may have otherwise been overlooked.

because if a problem exists then there is the possibility of creative solution. Sensitivity to science problems is also considered a component dimension of scien￾tific creativity. Ochse (1990) argued that sensitivity to problems is an important

formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution, which may

    Divergent thinking refers to the process of generating multiple ideas or solutions to a problem or challenge. Unlike convergent thinking, which aims to find the ""best"" or ""correct"" answer, divergent thinking encourages exploring various possibilities and perspectives. By allowing individuals to think beyond established norms and constraints, divergent thinking fosters innovation and originality. Creativity, on the other hand, encompasses the ability to generate novel and valuable ideas or creations. While both divergent and convergent thinking contribute to creativity, they differ in their approaches. Convergent thinking tends to rely on logical reasoning, systematic analysis, and adherence to established principles. It seeks to identify patterns, make connections, and arrive at a definitive solution. Conversely, divergent","creative production does not derive from divergent
thinking alone but also requires convergent thinking
(e.g., Brophy, 1998; Rickards, 1993). The contribution
of convergent thinking to the generation of creative
products is the subject of this article.
Convergent Versus Divergent Thinking
Convergent thinking is oriented toward deriving the
single best (or correct) answer to a clearly defined
question. It emphasizes speed, accuracy, logic, and the
like and focuses on recognizing the familiar, reapply￾ing set techniques, and accumulating information.
Therefore, it is most effective in situations where a
ready-made answer exists and needs simply to be re￾called from stored information or worked out from
what is already known by applying conventional and
logical search, recognition, and decision-making strat￾egies. One of the most important aspects of convergent
thinking is that it leads to a single best answer and,
thus, leaves no room for ambiguity: Answers are either
right or wrong. Convergent thinking is also intimately
linked to knowledge: On the one hand, it involves ma￾nipulation of existing knowledge by means of standard
procedures; and on the other hand, its main result is
production of increased knowledge.","thinking following on divergent thinking leads to a cor￾rect decision—in the case of convergent thinking we
can speak of “correct” and “incorrect”—to implement
change (i.e., to the introduction of effective novelty),
creativity occurs. This is the ideal result. Where con￾vergent thinking correctly leads to rejection of the vari￾ability generated through divergent thinking, the possi￾bility of disastrous change is avoided but at the risk of

Whether convergent or divergent products result de￾pends on the way in which this thinking power is ap￾plied: to produce more of the same, or to generate nov￾elty. This conceptualization of the interaction regards
differences between convergent and divergent thinking
as qualitative rather than quantitative: Regardless of
level, mental ability can tend to be convergent or diver￾gent. An example of this approach is seen in the work
of Hudson (1968).
The Alternation Approach
I prefer a conceptualization based on the “classical”
phase model, which was first introduced into creativity
research about 80 years ago (Wallas, 1926). In the
phase of preparation, a person becomes thoroughly fa￾miliar with a content area. In the incubation phase, the
person “churns through” or “stews over” the informa￾tion obtained in the previous phase. The phase of illu￾mination is marked by the emergence of a solution, not",74.52196621894836

    Pseudocreativity refers to the generation of novel ideas solely based on nonconformity, lack of discipline, blind rejection of what already exists, and simply going off one's own accord. This type of creativity often leads to surprising outcomes that deviate from the norm. On the other hand, QuasiCreativity involves generating effective novelty while maintaining some degree of conformity to existing norms. While it may still produce unexpected results, these effects are usually less disruptive than those resulting from pure pseudocreativity. Both forms of creativity have their merits and drawbacks depending on the specific situation and desired outcome. For example, in problem-solving scenarios where strict adherence to established methods might hinder innovation, pseudocreativity could be","on sensitivity to problems, word fluency, ideational
fluency, semantic flexibility, associational fluency, and
originality; all aspects of divergent thinking. However,
production of variability by means of fluency, flexibil￾ity, and originality does not, on its own, guarantee cre￾ativity. Variability may cause surprise in the beholder,
it is true, but this is not necessarily enough because sur￾prise can be produced through mere unregulated
self-expression (e.g., daubing paint on paper, writing
text in any way that pleases the writer, or picking out
notes at random on the piano) or by doing things differ￾ently from the usual regardless of accuracy, meaning,
sense, significance, or interest.

mere novelty and novelty that earns the label “creativ￾ity.” The former involves what Cattell and Butcher

creativity—such as a high level of fantasy—but only a
tenuous connection with reality. An example would be
the novelty generated in daydreams. What is needed for
creativity, however, is not just something that surprises
by deviating from the usual, but something that invokes
what Bruner (1962, p. 3) called “effective surprise.” The
questions that arise now are whether divergent thinking
alone generates effective novelty, whether convergent

seem to involve production of effective novelty without
convergent thinking are luck or chance and intuition.

There are many examples of apparently lucky com￾binations of events that led to acknowledged creative

Among the more theoretical discussions of the role
of chance in creativity is the evolutionary view of,
among others, Campbell (1960) and Simonton (1988).
In this approach, ideas are thought to evolve through
what Sternberg and Davidson (1999, p. 68) called
“haphazard recombinations” of ideas in a process of
“blind variation” (Campbell, 1960, p. 380). Occa￾sionally, a happy combination occurs: When this is rec￾ognized as involving a creative “configuration”
(Simonton, 1988, p. 2), “selective retention” (Camp￾bell, 1960, p. 380) occurs. However, even if this is an
accurate description of the process of production of ef￾fective novelty, the “mental elements” (Simonton,
1988, p. 6) involved in the haphazard recombinations
are themselves pieces of information (facts, principles,
relations, rules, laws, formulae, etc.)—in other words,",73.61657619476318

However, it also highlighted certain domains where women outperform men, indicating that creativity is not solely determined by biological factors but rather influenced by various contextual elements.

Gender Differences in Creativity
Kogan’s 1974 review. Yet we find that we share Kogan’s relief that although
there is considerable evidence of differences in patterns and areas of strengths
between the genders, there is still relative equality in creative ability.
There has clearly been a greater openness to investigating gender differences
in recent years, and some authors, such as Piirto (1991a, 1991b, 2004), have
made powerful arguments to explain the observed differences. Yet despite the
many studies that have been done, gender differences in creativity has not be￾come an important focus in either the creativity or psychology of women litera￾tures. A few examples of this neglect:
• A handbook on the psychology of women (Denmark & Paludi, 1993) hailed
as the most “comprehensive” and “systematic” review of literature available
on the psychology of women (Babledelis, 1995, p. 639) made no reference
to either creativity or divergent thinking. Neither did Unger’s (2001) Hand￾book of the Psychology of Women and Gender or Worrell’s (2001) two￾volume Encyclopedia of Women and Gender.
• Neither creativity nor divergent thinking is mentioned in the third and latest","Journal of Creative Behavior

For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of
creativity. However, to review gender differences in the results of creativity testing
means, for better or worse, reviewing mostly studies of gender differences in

Gender Differences in Creativity
ABSTRACT
Research on gender differences in creativity, including creativity test scores,
creative achievements, and self-reported creativity is reviewed, as are theories
that have been offered to explain such differences and available evidence that
supports or refutes such theories. This is a difficult arena in which to conduct
research, but there is a consistent lack of gender differences both in creativity test
scores and in the creative accomplishments of boys and girls (which if anything
tend to favor girls). As a result, it is difficult to show how innate gender differences
in creativity could possibly explain later differences in creative accomplishment.
At the same time, the large difference in the creative achievement of men and
women in many fields make blanket environmental explanations inadequate, and
the explanations that have been proposed thus far are at best incomplete. A new
theoretical framework (the APT model of creativity) is proposed to allow better
understanding of what is known about gender differences in creativity.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN SCORES ON CREATIVITY TESTS
Divergent thinking tests have dominated creativity testing, and the various Tor￾rance Tests (Torrance, 1966a, 1966b, 1966c, 1970, 1981, 1988, 1990a, 1990b;","78
Gender Differences in Creativity
EVIDENCE OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CREATIVITY
OVERVIEW
This section reviews research that touches on or directly addresses the ques￾tion of gender differences in creativity. We have divided this section based on
age (preschool/elementary, middle school, high school, and adults). When
participants fell into more than one age category, we used the age of the most
participants.
In the first subsection (Gender Differences in Scores on Creativity Tests), dif￾ferences in scores on creativity tests — mostly divergent thinking tests — are
considered. Here is a one-sentence summary of that subsection: While there are
research results pointing in various and often contradictory directions, the
evidence does not clearly support gender differences in creativity based on test
results; however, to the extent that a case for such gender differences can be
made, the available evidence suggests that women and girls tend to score higher
on creativity tests than men and boys.
The second subsection (Gender Differences in Subjective Assessments) goes
into more detail about self-assessments, assessments by others, and personality￾style assessments. The third subsection (Gender Differences in Creative Achieve￾ment) considers differences in creative accomplishment. This subsection does","creativity are most likely the product of differing environments would represent
the best overall synthesis of what we currently know about gender differences
in creativity.

The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have become some of the most widely used tools for measuring divergent thinking skills among individuals. These tests assess how well someone can generate unique ideas by considering multiple perspectives and exploring unconventional solutions. They consist of several tasks designed to challenge participants' ability to think creatively and come up with innovative thoughts. While there may be ongoing debates surrounding their validity and effectiveness, many researchers believe that these tests accurately measure divergent thinking abilities. For example, a study conducted by Arnold and Subotnik found that men tend to perform better on the Torrance Tests compared to women when it comes to generating novel ideas (Arnold et al., 1994).

For at least 25 years a debate has raged over the validity of these tests as
measures of creativity (e.g., Baer, 1993; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Crockenberg,
1972; Kogan, 1983; Oon-Chye & Bridgham, 1971; Runco, 1991a). It is interesting
to note in this regard that longitudinal validation studies of the Torrance Tests of
Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1966c, 1974) have suggested that these divergent
thinking tests are more predictive of creative behavior in males than females
(Arnold & Subotnik, 1994; Cramond, 1994; Howieson, 1981), although these
validity studies have themselves been criticized for lacking validity (Anastasi, 1982;
Baer, 1993; Crockenberg, 1972; Kogan, 1983). This review of gender differences
in creativity will not attempt either to review or to take sides in those controver￾sies; it will likewise remain agnostic regarding the validity of all other measures of
creativity. However, to review gender differences in the results of creativity testing
means, for better or worse, reviewing mostly studies of gender differences in
divergent thinking test scores.

    According to economic research on creativity, there are three main factors that contribute to its success: originality, value, and integration into the market. Originality refers to the uniqueness and novelty of one's creations, while value relates to their usefulness and desirability within specific contexts. Integration into the market involves considering both the individual merits of the creation and its potential impact on consumers' preferences and behaviors. In essence, being creative means producing something that stands out from existing offerings and meets the needs and desires of target audiences.

    In order to understand why Bethune believed certain works were the most appreciated, we need to examine their artistic qualities. These works possess unique characteristics that set them apart from others. For instance, they may exhibit exceptional skill, evoke strong emotions, challenge societal norms, or offer profound insights into the human experience. By analyzing these attributes, we gain insight into the artist's intentions and the impact their work has on viewers. Additionally, examining the historical context surrounding these works helps us appreciate how they have shaped our cultural landscape over time. Ultimately, the appreciation of a work of Genius lies in its ability to resonate with individuals on a personal and emotional level, leaving a lasting impression long after viewing.

It was common to conflate creativity and genius in
Bethune’s (1839) era, and, in fact, that same blend can
be seen well into the 1900s.

the two facets of genius:

And as imagination bodies forth

The position of knowledge as the basis of creativity
has been put in more formal terms by Boden (1994a),
using the language of artifical intelligence. What I call
“knowledge,” Boden (1994a) called “cognitive maps”
of a “conceptual space” (p. 8). The more structural fea￾tures of a conceptual space such as, let us say, music
are represented in a person’s mind (i.e., the more the
person knows about music, the more creative the per￾son can be). Boden (1994a) gave the example of Mo￾zart and concluded that Mozart’s creativity arose from
his vast musical knowledge.

These geniuses were able to engage in activities like creating new combinations of thoughts and presenting them clearly and forcefully. They had the ability to bring fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to problems. Additionally, they demonstrated exceptional talent and skill in their chosen fields.
