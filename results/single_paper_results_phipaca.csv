A scientific creativity test for secondary school
students
Weiping Hu, Shanxi Teachers’ University, China and Philip Adey, King’s College London, UK
This study describes the development of a test of scientific creativity for use with secondary school
students. A Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM) was constructed on the basis of an analysis of
meanings and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. 50 science teachers in China took
part in an initial evaluation of this model. On the basis of their analyses and comments, and drawing on
the experience of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, a 7-item scale for measuring scientific
creativity of secondary school students was developed and validated through analyses of item response data of 160 secondary school students in England. Item analyses were conducted to check on item
discrimination, internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct-related validity, and face validity. Analysis showed adequate reliabilities and validities. As an example of how the test might be
used, data from the pilot use of the test were used to investigate the relative scientific creativity of
students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary","presented an investment theory of creativity. The theory comprises six resources
for creativity of which intelligence is one. Although creativity is related to intelli- gence, it is also influenced by other factors, such as motivation, personality, knowl- edge, and environment. The development of creativity is the effect of all these
factors. So intelligence appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity (Rossiman and Horn 1971); that is, although intelligence appears to
allow the development of creativity, it does not ensure that creative expression
always will be forthcoming (Schubert 1973). It is clear that all these theories and
researches are consistent with the conclusion of the present pilot study.
Summary and further work
The study reported here is a preliminary attempt to develop and validate a scien￾tific creativity test for secondary school students, with the hope that more empiri- cal work of this nature will be taken up by interested creativity and science
education researchers. A 7-item test was developed based on a Scientific Creativity Structure Model derived from theoretical accounts of the nature of
scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",80.99862051010132

Defining what constitutes ""scientific"" creativity can pose significant difficulties because there exists no universally accepted standard across disciplines when discussing concepts like innovation, discovery, invention etc., making any comparison difficult. Additionally, even if scientists were able to agree upon a single measure of success they would still face difficulty determining whether their work meets expectations based solely on its output; rather than relying exclusively on external measures of quality then perhaps internal criteria could better reflect true achievement - i.e. self-evaluations made by those working towards achieving goals through experimentation/problem solving activities. Furthermore, while existing methods used to evaluate student performance often focus primarily on test scores alone without taking into account broader learning outcomes, potential biases associated with standardized testing formats make them less effective tools for","that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.
The nature of scientific creativity
Before considering how such an instrument might be developed, we need to ana￾lyse commonly held understandings of the meanings and nature of scientific crea￾tivity. The concept of creativity has proven over the years to be an elusive one to
define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be
based.
In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:
(1) Scientific creativity is different from other creativity since it is concerned
with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and
solving, and creative science activity.
(2) Scientific creativity is a kind of ability. The structure of scientific crea￾tivity itself does not include non-intellectual factors, although non-intel￾lectual factors may influence scientific creativity.
(3) Scientific creativity must depend on scientific knowledge and skills.
(4) Scientific creativity should be a combination of static structure and
developmental structure. The adolescent and the mature scientist have
the same basic mental structure of scientific creativity but that of the
latter is more developed.
(5) Creativity and analytical intelligence are two different factors of a singu￾lar function originating from mental ability.
Existing tests","measuring instruments. In general creativity research, the proliferation of research
is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

The core dimensions of creativity according to Torrance include fluency, flexibility, and originality - these represent different aspects of what it takes to produce innovative solutions within any field. According to Howard Gardner, there are four main types of cognitive skills required when engaging in creative activities; problem solving, imagination/creativity, pattern recognition, and intuition. These elements combine together into ""theory"" – meaning you need both analytical reasoning and imaginative insight to come up with new ways of doing things. Additionally, research has shown that people who score highly on measures of emotional stability tend to have better outcomes overall compared to those scoring lower. This suggests that having good mental health plays a key part in fostering successful innovation. Finally, individuals often draw inspiration from","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

Divergent thinking plays a crucial part in fostering innovative solutions within various areas of study including those found in sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology etc.. It enables scientists to think beyond conventional boundaries by exploring alternative perspectives on existing theories/methodologies leading them towards novel discoveries. By encouraging individuals to explore multiple paths when approaching complex issues they are able to develop unique ideas and approaches resulting in breakthrough innovations. Furthermore, this type of critical analysis allows researchers to identify gaps in their current research methods allowing them to refine techniques and improve outcomes over time. Ultimately, diversified ways of looking at things allow people to better understand how different elements interact together creating opportunities for growth both personally and professionally.  <|endoftext|>Title: How My","divergent thinking is no longer considered to be synonymous with creative ability,

define. As early as 1960, Rapucci (quoted by Welsch 1981) counted between 50
and 60 definitions in the literature on creativity. Twenty years later, an extensive
review forced Welsch (1981) to conclude that the literature contains such a vari- ance of definitional statements that the task of arriving at an integrated and agreed
definition is virtually impossible. Different perceptions of the meaning of creativ￾ity have led to a correspondingly wide variety of techniques to assess creativity. Nevertheless it is possible to detect some common themes and we will attempt to
combine these into a model of scientific creativity. For example, many researchers combine two or more aspects of the creative process, creative product, creative person and creative environment in defining creativity. In considering the scien￾tific creativity of individual secondary school students within a given school
system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general",87.56243205070496

Assistant: According to the given definition, scientific creativity is distinguished from other forms of creativity by its concern with creative science experiments, creative scientific problem finding and solving, and creative science activity.","
According to our analysis, there are three main components distinguish­ing scientific creativity from other types of creativity - its focus on experimentation; its emphasis on solving problems through logical reasoning rather than artistic expression; and its reliance upon existing knowledge and skill sets instead of relying solely on imagination. Additionally, scientists often work collaboratively while maintaining their own unique perspectives and approaches towards achieving desired outcomes. These distinct features make scientific creativity highly specialized compared to other forms of creativity like artistry or music composition where individuals can express themselves freely without constraints imposed by logic alone. Furthermore, because scientific creativity relies heavily on empirical evidence and data collection methods, it differs significantly from abstract arts whose primary goal is self-expression and emotional resonance. Lastly, unlike imaginative endeavors rooted in subjective","research into scientific creativity, and the cultivation of scientific creativity may be

In summary, and in the light of exploration of creativity in the literature, we define scientific creativity as a kind of intellectual trait or ability producing or potentially producing a certain product that is original and has social or personal
value, designed with a certain purpose in mind, using given information. This definition may be elaborated with a set of hypotheses about the structure of scien￾tific creativity:

is to a large extent due to the availability of instruments purportedly measuring
creativity.
However, general creativity tests will not do for assessing scientific creativity. There is a general consensus that domain-specific knowledge and skills are a major component of creativity. Alexander (1992) and Amabile (1987) emphasized the need for specific domain or discipline-based knowledge and skills for creative
thinking. This issue was also addressed by Findlay and Lumsden (1988) and
Mumford et al. (1991) who defined being knowledgeable as having a knowledge base that is conceptually well-organized and for which retrieval is fluent and
efficient in relation to demand in a given problem-solving or creative thinking
situation. Other researchers (Albert 1983, Gardner 1983, Feldman 1986) also con- cluded that creativity is domain specific. As Barron and Harrington (1981) sug- gested, more domain-specific aspects of divergent thought may underlie creative productivity. According to his research, Sternberg (1996) concluded that the cor￾relation coefficient of creativity between different areas is only 0.37. We conclude
that the scientific creativity of secondary school students, a kind of domain-specific
creativity, cannot be measured by tests designed for other content areas or age groups.

project, and the other was the main researcher. Pearson product-moment correla￾tion coefficients between the two sets of scores are presented in table 3. The
correlations between scores vary from 0.793 to 0.913 with a median of 0.875. The results suggest that the scoring procedure is adequately objective.
Validity
Two aspects of the validity were investigated. One is construct-related validity. Guilford (1950) explicitly stated that the first step in validating creativity tests
should be factorial validity, a form of construct validity, determined by factor analysis of test scores. When factor analysis with principal components was run
on the data from this test, only one factor was obtained. The solution cannot be
rotated. As shown in table 4, all items loaded sizeably (from 0.685 to 0.840) on to
one factor which explains 63% of the total variance. Kline (1993) suggested items
selected for a unifactorial test should load significantly on only one factor, and in most cases the load should be larger than 0.3. According to Horn and Cattell
(1966) creativity is a second order ability factor titled a ‘retrieval capacity’ or","system, the creative environment is out of control of the students so we will aim
for a three-dimensional model. Torrance (1990) considered fluency, flexibility, and original thinking as cen￾tral features of creativity. Fluency means the number of original ideas produced,
flexibility is the ability to ‘change tack’, not to be bound by an established
approach after that approach is found no longer to work efficiently. Originality
is interpreted statistically: an answer which is rare, which occurs only occasionally
in a given population, is considered original. Hudson (1966) took a similar approach. In asking students how many uses they could think of for a brick, he
collected all the answers and gave higher scores to the answers which were rare
(which occurred only infrequently) than to common answers. Fluency, flexibility, and originality thus form one dimension of the model, one which can be described
as being a personality trait, the characteristics of the creative person. Although

to identify creative scientific talent perceived as necessary to solve mankind’s pres- ent and future problems. Also searching for such talent, Sinha and Singh (1987)

imagination, analysis capabilities, and transformation abilities. Although these tests are useful in measuring scientific creativity of secondary
school students, they are somewhat dependent on science knowledge, so they can
not be used for assessing scientific creativity of junior high school students whose
scientific knowledge is limited. We also question their cross-cultural applicability
since they were developed within specific cultural groups. We believe there
remains a need to develop a test which can be used for assessing the scientific
creativity of all secondary school students at different ages and in different
cultures.
The development of the test
The three dimensional model of scientific creativity described above offers 24 cells
for each of which items may in principle be designed. In order to explore the face validity of these cells, a questionnaire was developed with two items for each of the 24 cells – that is 48 items in total. 50 science education researchers and secondary
school science teachers in China were asked to review these 48 items and select
those which he or she thought would demonstrate scientific creativity in secondary
school students. The result suggested that some aspects were considered more
important and viable than others and on this basis an initial test of nine items was drafted. Each item encompassed more than one cell of the model. In drafting these nine items, we referred also to existing general creativity","Full Terms & Conditions of access and use can be found at

The next step would involve conducting additional studies involving participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. These could include comparing scores across multiple languages, examining relationships among various types of creative tasks within each language group, evaluating reliability through repeated testing using similar measures, exploring how predictors influence performance, etc. Additionally, predictions regarding potential applications of the test findings must be explored before its implementation into educational settings. Finally, longitudinal followup assessments should be conducted after implementing the test to evaluate changes in levels of scientific creativity observed during use.  <|endofinput> | <output1>. Output 1 - A valid measurement tool capable of accurately identifying individuals' abilities when applied correctly. <+Output2+ > An effective assessment method able to identify individual strengths and weaknesses concerning","scientific creativity. Internal consistency, agreement between scorers, construct￾related validity and face validity were found to be satisfactory. For the sample
tested, comparisons were made in terms of the students’ age and science ability
level. The result of these investigations suggest that this test should be useful in
assessing scientific creativity of secondary school students. However, more work needs been done to further validate the test. Test-retest
reliability should be evaluated. Relationships between this test and other scientific
creativity tests as well as other general creativity tests might be studied. More
importantly, predictive validity should be determined. In developing this test, we started with a questionnaire given to Chinese as well as English science educa￾tion researchers and science teachers, but only English students took part in this
study. So larger samples from different cultures should be investigated in future
research.
Although this study concluded that with the increase of age, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity, we cannot generalize these
conclusions beyond the present limited sample. Nevertheless we believe that the","students of different age and ability level. The results indicated that for this trial sample, the scientific
creativity of secondary school students increases with increase in age, and science ability is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for scientific creativity. Further work is also suggested.
Introduction why scientific creativity?
This paper will describe the development of a test of scientific creativity. It may
immediately be asked why another test of such creativity is required, since over 100 creativity tests have already been reported in the literature. The answer lies in
the specific needs of scientific creativity. Firstly, ‘doing science’ is far more than
either mastering an existing body of knowledge or of following set procedures. Almost by definition scientific research requires creativity in the sense of going
beyond existing knowledge and techniques, of creating new understandings. But even at a more mundane level, solving problems in science requires a student to
explore his or her repertoire, to imagine a variety of routes to a solution, and
frequently to create novel combinations of knowledge or novel techniques for a
solution. This is the justification for considering scientific creativity as worthy of
attention in the education of students who will either become scientists or who need an understanding of the way that scientists work as part of their general","tific creativity of secondary school students, as a domain creativity, should be
unifactor so it is reasonable for us only get one factor in the analysis. The result
suggested that the test has good construct-related validity, measuring one factor, scientific creativity. Another type of validity determined in this study is face validity: do the items
look like they test scientific creativity? To obtain a measure of face validity of the
creativity test, 35 science education researchers and science teachers from England
and China were asked the question, ‘which items in the test can measure scientific
creativity of secondary school students?’ The results are shown in table 5, suggest￾ing a high degree of face validity amongst science education researchers and
science teachers.
Acceptability to students
Finally, for a test to be used successfully in assessing scientific creativity of sec- ondary school students, it should have at least some level of acceptance by the
students. To test this, 60 students tested were asked the question, ‘Which items did you find interesting and which uninteresting in the test?’ Results are shown in
table 6, indicating a satisfactory level of acceptability by the students.
